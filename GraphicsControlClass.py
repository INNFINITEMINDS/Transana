""" A class for implementing a scrollable Graphics Control.
    This control should expose it's Device Context for external
    manipulation (drawing) and so that it can be easily sent to
    a Printer.

    The following methods are currently implemented:
      __init__(parent,                   Parent Frame
               ID,                       ID
               pos=wxPoint(100, 100),    Position within Parent (Will be full frame if only control)
               size=(800, 600),          Size within Parent (Will be full frame if only control)
               canvassize=(999, 999),    Size of the underlying graphics canvas (Visual control will shrink to fit)
               drawEnabled=false,        Is free-hand drawing enabled?
               visualizationMode=false,  Is this used for the Visualization in Transana?  (Cannot be used with
                                         drawEnabled, as both options specify how to process mouse events.  If true,
                                         this optimizes graphic creation speed as well.)
               passMouseEvents=false)    Should the GraphicsControlClass pass MouseEvents back up to the parent?
                                            Currently supported events for this are:
                                              OnLeftDown()
                                              OnLeftUp()
               name=None                 Object identifier, used by Synchronize.py.  event.GetId() isn't returning the correct
                                         object Id on the Mac.

      SetColour(colour)                  Sets Drawing Color (using wxNamedColours)
      SetFontColour(colour)              Sets Text Color (using wxNamedColours)
      SetThickness(thickness)            Sets Drawing Line Thickness
      SetFontSize(size)                  Sets Font Size
      AddLines(newlines)                 Adds lines to drawing.  Newlines are a list of 4-integer tuples, each specifying (startx, starty, endx, endy).
                                         Thus, [(300, 300, 300, 700), (300, 700, 700, 700), (700, 700, 700, 300), (700, 300, 300, 300)] draws a square.
      AddLines2(newlines)                Adds lines to drawing in a second layer.  Newlines are a list of 4-integer tuples, each specifying (startx, starty, endx, endy).
                                         This second layer can be used for temporary data that could be deleted without affecting the first layer.
      AddText(text, x, y)                Adds Text at position (x, y)
      AddTextCentered(text, x, y)        Adds Text centered on position (x, y)
      Clear()                            Clears the graphic
      GetMaxWidth(start=0)               Returns the width of the widest label in the list after start (which is used to skip titles)
      LoadFile(filename.bmp)             Loads a BITMAP image, which is resized to fit the control
      SaveAs                             Saves the Buffered Image as a JPEG graphic
      SetDimensions(x, y, width, height) Alters the dimensions of the Graphic Area, including resizing the underlying Bitmap if there is one.
