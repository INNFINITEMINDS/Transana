IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTE:

If you want to analyze Apple media formats such as *.mov, *.m4v, and *.m4a, you will need to install Apple's free QuickTime player for Windows.  You can download the QuickTime player for free from the Apple web site at http://www.apple.com.  Please note that there are security concerns about the QuickTime Player.  You may want to process such files using Transana's Media Conversion Tool instead to convert them to *.mp4 format.
