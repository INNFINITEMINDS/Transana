<H2><I>Starting Transana</I><HR></H2>

You should run Transana while you do this tutorial so that you can perform the tasks as they are explained. If you are already running the tutorial from within Transana, skip ahead to the next page now. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Microsoft Windows Activity: </FONT>To start Transana, click Start on the Taskbar, point to Programs, select the Transana 2 Program Group, then click Transana 2.x from the submenu. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh Activity:</FONT> To start Transana, open your Applications folder, double-click the Transana 2 folder, and then double-click the Transana program icon. <P>

<H3>Single-user Transana</H3>

The <B>single-user </B>version of Transana prompts you to select a database.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/selectdatabasesu.gif"  ALT="selectdatabasesu"   BORDER=0><P>

If you already have a tutorial database, select that from the list.  If you don't already have a tutorial database, you can make up a database name, such as your initials followed by the word &quot;Tutorial&quot; and click OK. (Please note that spaces and punctuation symbols are not allowed in database names.)  Transana creates the appropriate database files for you automatically.<P>

<H3>Multi-user Transana</H3>

The <B>multi-user </B>version of Transana requires that you log in to your database server and select a database. Transana prompts you for your user name, password, database server, and database name. If you don't have a username, password, database server name, and database name, ask your project administrator or your technical support representative for this information.<P>

If a tutorial database exists and your account has permission to access it, select that from the list.  If you don't have a tutorial database, you can use your project database, but should clearly identify the data objects you create during the tutorial as being related to the tutorial.  Then, when you are done with the Tutorial, you should delete all of your personal Tutorial data.<P>

<H3>Computer-lab version of Transana</H3>

When you use Transana in a public computer lab, you need to start by letting Transana know where to look for and store your data.  If you are using the computer lab version, it's because you are using a computer where you should not store your personal data, probably for confidentiality reasons and because many computer labs prohibit permanent data storage on lab computers.<P>

In this situation, you need to have your own storage device, such as an external hard drive, a large flash disk, or a network storage location you can access from the lab, where you will keep your media files and your analytic data.  You need to connect your drive to the lab computer and make sure you know how to access it prior to starting Transana.  It might be the "H:" drive on Windows, and it might be called "MyDrive" on OS X.<P>

When you start the <B>computer-lab</B> version of Transana, the following dialog is the first to appear:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/complabsetup.gif"  ALT="Computer Lab Setup Dialog"   BORDER=0><P>

The <B>video root directory</B> setting tells Transana where to find your media files.  Assuming you have attached a Drive "H:" or a "MyDrive" volume as described earlier, you might browse to "H:\Video" on Windows or "/Volumes/MyDrive/Video" on the Mac.<P>

The <B>waveform directory</B> setting tells Transana where to store your extracted audio files, used for creating the waveform diagrams.  Browse to "H:/Video/waveforms" on Windows or "/Volumes/MyDrive/Video/waveforms" on OS X.  You should not store these files on a public computer, as this could compromise the confidentiality of your subjects.<P>

The <B>database directory</B> setting is where Transana will look for the files that contain the analytic data you have created in Transana.  Browse to "H:\database" or "/Volumes/MyDrive/database".<P>

Once you have entered the directory information, the <B>computer-lab </B>version of Transana prompts you to select a database.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/selectdatabasesu.gif"  ALT="selectdatabasesu"   BORDER=0><P>

If you already have a tutorial database, type in the name of the database.  Transana will not remember the name of your database from one session to the next, as such configuration information should not be stored on a public computer.  If you don't already have a tutorial database, you can make up a database name, such as your initials followed by the word &quot;Tutorial&quot; and click OK. (Please note that spaces and punctuation symbols are not allowed in database names.)  Transana creates the appropriate database files for you automatically if needed.<P>
