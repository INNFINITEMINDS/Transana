<H1>Snapshot Window</H1><HR>

Please note that the <B>Basic</B> version of Transana does not support Snapshots.  To use this feature, you must be using the <B>Professionsal</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, or <B>Multiuser</B> version of Transana.<P> 

Transana's Snapshot window is how one works with still images in an analysis in Transana.  The Snapshot Window is designed to be very flexible, allowing researchers to represent analytic meaning of still images in several different ways.<P>

There are two different ways to code Snapshots.  You can apply keywords to the whole image using the <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot Properties</A> dialog, or by pressing the <IMG SRC="images/keywordgroupicon.gif">&nbsp;  button in the toolbar.  You can also add detail coding by drawing coding shapes on the Snapshot.  (See below.)<P>

<IMG SRC="images/snapshot1.gif"  ALT="snapshot1"   BORDER=0><P>

By default, the Snapshot window opens in Exploration Mode, where you can zoom, resize, and reposition your view of your image without changing the way the Snapshot will be displayed the next time you open it.  You can also show and hide existing detail coding in Exploration mode without affecting the saved version of the Snapshot.  This mode is designed to allow you to explore your coded still image without altering how it is represented in the data.<P>  

Pressing the <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif">&nbsp; button puts you in Edit mode, where all changes you make are automatically saved and where you can add new detail coding to the image.  Please note that if you change the view of your Snapshot in Exploration mode, then enter Edit mode, the changes you have made to the image display will be saved.  Restore Last Save, in the File menu on Windows and in a toolbar on OS X, will undo changes you have made in Edit Mode before you exit Edit mode and save them.<P>

One way to focus analytic attention onto part of an image is to zoom into a portion of the image and save the snapshot on just the desired portion of the image.  <P> 

<IMG SRC="images/snapshot2.gif"  ALT="snapshot2"   BORDER=0><P>

You can also create multiple snapshots of different parts of the image, if that's approriate for your analysis.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/snapshot3.gif"  ALT="snapshot3"   BORDER=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<IMG SRC="images/snapshot4.gif"  ALT="snapshot4"   BORDER=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<IMG SRC="images/snapshot5.gif"  ALT="snapshot5"   BORDER=0><P>

It's also possible, when in Edit mode, to draw coding shapes on the Snapshot to preserve the image context while still drawing attention to particular details.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/snapshot6.gif"  ALT="snapshot6"   BORDER=0><P>  

For Detail coding, each Keyword is defined with a combination of color, coding tool (shape), line width, and line style.  The same coding style is used for all instance of the same Keyword, but should differ from one Keyword to the next.  (Default Snapshot coding styles can also be defined in the <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keyword Properties</A> to improve consistency across Snapshots.) <P> 

Coding Colors can be defined using Transana's <A HREF="colorconfiguration.htm">Graphics Color Configuration</A> tool.  Coding shapes available include rectangle, ellipse, line, and arrow.  Multiple lines can be used to create more complex shapes on a Snapshot.<P>

The <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif">&nbsp; button in the toolbar displays the Snapshot Coding Key, which is very useful when several different keywords have been applied to a Snapshot.  Please note that if the Snapshot Coding Key is displayed when a Snapshot is exported or inserted into a Document or Transcript, the Coding Key will be included as part of the exported image.  If the key is not displayed, it will not be included in the image export.<p>
