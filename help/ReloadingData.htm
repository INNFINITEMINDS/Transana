<H2><I>Reloading your Data</I><HR></H2>

Now that you've gotten some practice with transcription and time-coding, you are probably ready for a short break.  Quit Transana.  If you did not save your Transcript first, notice that Transana prompts you to save it before the program stops running. When you are ready to return to this Tutorial, follow these directions to reload your media file.<P>

To reload your Episode and continue working, the first thing you need to do is locate the Transcript on which you wish to work.  A single Episode might have more than one Transcript because it is being analyzed in more than one way.  For example, one Transcript may represent field notes, a second Transcript could be a verbatim record of the portions that the principle investigator thinks are interesting, and a third, Jeffersonian Transcript may cover a different part of the video that a graduate student is analyzing using Conversation Analytic techniques.  In this circumstance, you have one Episode, but Transana must know with which of the three Transcripts you want to work.  Thus, you load a media file by selecting one of the associated Transcripts.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> To reload the demonstration video, use the Data window.<P>

1. Click the + (on Windows) or triangle (on Mac) next to the <B>Libraries</B> node.  You see all the Library records you have created.<P>

2. Click the + or triangle next to the Library called <B>Demonstration Data</B>. You see all the Documents and Episodes in the Demonstration Data Library and any Library Notes you may have created.<P>

3. Click the + or triangle next to the Episode called <B>Transana with Media</B>. You see all the Transcripts for this Episiode and any Episode Notes you may have created.<P>

4. Double-click <B>Transcript</B>.<P>

5.  If you are using Transana <B>Professional</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, or <B>Multiuser</B>, you can also double-click the <B>Transana with Text</B> Document.  (Transana <B>Basic</B> does not support Documents.)  You will notice that the Document opens in an additional tab in the Document Window.  The Visualization and Data Windows shift to show information about the Document.  If you click back on the <B>Transcript</B> tab in the Document Window, you will see the main interface shift back to the Transana with Media Episode.<P>

You will notice that Transana behaves a bit differently for different types of data.  Text data (Documents and Quotes) open in new tabs in the Document Window.  Because media files require significantly more program resources and take longer to activate, only one media-based data element (Episode or Clip) can be loaded at a time.  Still image data (Snapshots, which we haven't discussed yet,) load in separate windows rather than loading in Transana's main interface because because the size and shape of the Snapshot windows can have analytic meaning.  While this is inconsistent from a software interface point of view, it is driven by the different demands of the different data types.<P>     

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  Transana has the capacity to display multiple simultaneous transcripts.  See <A HREF="multitrans.htm">Working with Multiple Transcripts</A> in the <A HREF="manual.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more information.<P>
