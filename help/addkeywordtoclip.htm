<H2><I>Adding a Keyword to an Existing Clip</I><HR></H2>

It is quite likely that you will want to add new keywords to existing clips at some point in your analysis.  For example, we created a new keyword while creating the clip <B>Houses</B> that we probably want to apply to the <B>Introduction</B> clip.  Because this sort of coding is such a central analytic activity, Transana provides several ways to do this.<P>

First, create two new keywords in the <B>Tutorial</B> keywords group.  Add the Keywords <B>Introduction</B> and <B>Definition</B> to the <B>Tutorial</B> group.  (See <A HREF="creatingkeywords.htm">Creating Keywords</A> if you cannot remember how to create new keywords.)<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to add a keyword to a clip. The quickest method is to use the database tree in the Data window to apply keywords to clips. <P>

1. Make sure the Keywords node in the database tree is fully expanded. (If necessary, click the <B>+</B> or triangle next to <B>Keywords, </B>then the <B>+</B> or triangle next to <B>Tutorial</B>.)<P>

2. Click to select the keyword <B>Introduction</B> from the list of keywords.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:  </FONT>Drag the keyword <B>Introduction</B> up and drop it on the clip <B>Introduction</B> under the <B>Symmetry</B> collection in the database tree. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:  </FONT>Right-click the keyword <B>Introduction</B> and select &quot;Copy&quot; from the popup menu.  Then right-click the Clip <B>Introduction</B> in the <B>Symmetry</B> collection in the database tree.  Select the &quot;Paste&quot; option from the resulting menu.<P>

Transana displays a dialog box asking you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.<P>

Note that you can add a keyword to all the clips in a collection by pasting or dropping the keyword on the collection name.  Drag or copy the keyword <B>Symmetry</B> onto the collection <B>Symmetry</B> to ensure that all of the clips in that collection include that keyword.  Note that clips that already have the Symmetry keyword will not be changed because of this duplication, but also note that clips you add to this collection later are <B>not</B> automatically given the <B>Symmetry</B> keyword.  <P>

You can also add keywords to episodes and to all episodes in a series using copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop within the Database tab of the Data Window. <P>

Sometimes you might want to view a clip and its transcript while deciding what keywords are appropriate.  Use this method to add the keyword <B>Definition</B> to the clip called Introduction. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1. Load the clip by double-clicking the clip <B>Introduction</B> in the collection <B>Symmetry</B> in the database tree. <P>

2. First, check in the Options menu to make sure that <B>Quick Clip Mode</B> is not checked.  Drag the keyword <B>Definition</B> from the <B>Tutorial</B> keyword group under the <B>Keywords</B> root node in the database tree, and drop it on the Transcript window. Transana opens a dialog box that asks you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.  (If <B>Quick Clips Mode</B> is checked, this action will create a Quick Clip rather than applying the keyword to the Episode or Clip currently loaded.)<P>

Also notice the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. This tab displays a list of keywords associated with the clip or the episode that is loaded in the Transana main interface windows. This tab allows you to edit or delete keywords from a clip or an episode.<P>

3. Click the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. Transana shows the keywords associated with the <B>Introduction</B> clip. <P>

4. Right-click anywhere on this tab and choose <B>Edit</B> from the pop-up menu. <P>

Transana opens the <B>Edit Keyword List</B> dialog box, which looks like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/editkeywords.gif"  ALT="editkeywords"   BORDER=0><P>

5. If the <B>keyword group : keyword</B> pair <B>Tutorial : Symmetry</B> is not already listed in the Keywords box, select the <B>Tutorial</B> keyword group, then double-click the <B>Symmetry</B> keyword to add it to the clip.  Click <B>OK</B> if you added the keyword, <B>Cancel</B> if you did not.<P>

Transana also allows you to add or delete keywords for episodes and clips from the Properties dialog box that is associated with each episode or clip.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Use the database tree in the Data window. Follow these directions to add a keyword to the <B>Demo</B> episode: <P>

1. Right-click the <B>Demo</B> episode in the <B>Geometry by Design</B> series under the <B>Series</B> root node in the database tree, and choose <B>Episode Properties </B>from the pop-up menu. <P>

2. In the dialog box that appears, click on <B>Tutorial</B> keyword group in the field labeled <B>Keyword Group</B>. Then double-click <B>Symmetry</B> in the field labeled <B>Keyword</B> to add it to the Episode.  You should see the keyword group : keyword pair appear in the <B>Episode Keywords</B> box to signal that the keyword has been added to the episode.  Click <B>OK</B> when you are done.<P>

If this were a real analysis, you would want to edit your analytic memos as you were going along making these coding changes.  In each appropriate note, you would add a date/time stamp and an explanation of the coding changes performed for each data object within Transana.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Because this is a practice analysis, let's just update one note.<P>

1.  Locate the analytic memo note that you created earlier for the <B>Introduction</B> clip.  Double-click this note to open it for editing.<P>

2.  Decide if you want to add new commentary to the top of the note or to the bottom and place your cursor at the appropriate location.  Press Ctrl-T to add a date/time stamp, and document your decision to add the <B>Symmetry</B>, <B>Introduction</B>, and <B>Definition</B> keywords to this clip.  It is a good idea to leave a blank line between process notes from different days in your analytic memos.  Exit the note when you are done making your changes.<P>
