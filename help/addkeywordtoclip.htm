It is quite likely that you will want to add new keywords to existing clips at some point in your analysis.  Because this sort of coding is such a central analytic activity, Transana provides several ways to do this.<P>
First, create two new keywords in the <B>Demonstration Keywords</B> group.  Add the Keywords <B>Introduction</B> and <B>Definition</B> to the group.  <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to add a keyword to a clip. The quickest method is to use the database tree in the Data window to apply keywords to clips. <P>
1. Make sure the Keywords node in the database tree is fully expanded. (If necessary, click the <B>+</B> next to <B>Keywords, </B>then the <B>+</B> next to <B>Demonstration Keywords</B>.)<P>
2. Click to select the keyword <B>Introduction</B> from the list of keywords.  <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Windows-only Alternative:  </FONT>Drag the keyword up to clip <B>Introduction</B> under the <B>Symmetry</B> collection in the database tree. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh or Windows Alternative:  </FONT>Right-click the keyword and select &quot;Copy&quot; from the popup menu.  Then right-click the Clip <B>Introduction</B> under the <B>Symmetry</B> collection in the database tree.  Select the &quot;Paste&quot; option from the resulting menu.<P>
Transana displays a dialog box asking you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.<P>
Note that you can add a keyword to all the clips in a collection by pasting or dropping the keyword on the collection name. You can also add keywords to episodes and to all episodes in a series using copy-and-paste (or drag-and-drop on Windows) within the Database tab of the Data Window. <P>
Sometimes you might want to view a clip and its transcript while deciding what keywords are appropriate.  Use this method to add the keyword <B>Definition</B> to the clip called Introduction. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>
1. Load the clip by double-clicking <B>Introduction</B> under <B>Symmetry</B> in the database tree. <P>
2. <FONT COLOR="Red">Windows-only Alternative:</FONT>  Drag the keyword <B>Definition </B>under <B>Demonstration Group </B>under the <B>Keywords </B>node in the database tree, and drop it on the Transcript window. Transana opens a dialog box that asks you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh or Windows Alternative:  </FONT>Notice the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. This tab provides a list of keywords associated with the clip or the episode that is in the Transcript window. This list allows you to edit or delete keywords from a clip or an episode.<P>
3. Click the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. Transana shows the keywords associated with the Introduction clip. <P>
4. Right-click anywhere on this tab and choose <B>Edit</B> from the pop-up menu. <P>

Transana opens the <B>Edit Keyword List</B> dialog box, which looks like this:<P>
<IMG SRC="images/editkeywords.gif"  ALT="editkeywords"   BORDER=0><P>
5. If the keyword group : keyword pair <B>Demonstration Keywords : Definition</B> is not already listed in the Keywords box, select the <B>Demonstration Keywords</B> keyword group, then double-click the <B>Definition</B> keyword to add it to the clip.  Click <B>OK</B> if you added the keyword, <B>Cancel</B> if you did not.<P>
Transana also allows you to add or delete keywords for episodes and clips from the Properties dialog box that is associated with each episode or clip. Note that you can't edit the properties of a clip that is currently loaded. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Use the database tree in the Data window. Follow these directions to add a keyword to the Sample Video episode: <P>
1. Right-click <B>Sample Video, </B>under <B>Sample, </B>under the <B>Series </B>node in the database tree, and choose <B>Episode Properties </B>from the pop-up menu. <P>
2. In the dialog box that appears, click on <B>Demonstration Keywords </B>group in the field labeled <B>Keyword Group</B>. Then double-click <B>Symmetry </B>in the field labeled <B>Keyword </B>to add it to the Episode. Click <B>OK</B> when you are done.<P>
