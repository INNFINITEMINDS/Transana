<H2><I>Creating Keyword Groups and Keywords</I><HR></H2>

As you probably know, <B><I>coding</I></B> is a central activity in many forms of qualitative analysis.  While it would be unusual to start a qualitative analysis with a well-developed coding scheme, it is not at all unusual to want to identify raw video files with some of their primary characteristics from the beginning of the analytic process.  There are often some initial codes that apply to an entire raw video file that a researcher wants to make sure get applied throughout analysis.  In education research, the name of the teacher, the school, the classroom subject or grade level, and the curriculum being used are common examples.  <P>

This is where we will begin working with Transana.  Our Demo data file contains video from one particular teacher implementing one particular curriculum, but is taken from a study that looked at multiple teachers implementing several different curricula.  It is important to the larger research project (although admittedly not to the Tutorial) to be able to sort out clips by teacher and by curriculum.  So we know at the outset that we want to code the Demo video for the teacher's name and the name of the curriculum she is using.  We will start by creating codes that reflect this desired information.<P>

In Transana, you use the Data window to create and manage keywords in order to develop a coding system. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions (Macintosh single-button mouse users should Control-click instead of right-click):<P>

1. To create a keyword group, right-click the <B>Keywords</B> node in the database tree, then click <B>Add Keyword Group</B>.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/addkeywordgroup.gif"  ALT="addkeywordgroup"   BORDER=0><P>

You see the following dialog box:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/newkeywordgroup.gif"  ALT="newkeywordgroup"   BORDER=0><P>

2. Enter <B>Tutorial</B> as the Keyword Group name and click OK.  Transana creates your first keyword group.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/demokeywords.gif"  ALT="demokeywords"   BORDER=0><P>

(Please note that this keyword group will not be saved in the Transana database until you put some keywords in it!  If you quit Transana right now, that group will not exist when you restart the program.)<P>

3. The next step is to add a keyword to this group. Right-click <B>Tutorial</B>, then click <B>Add Keyword </B>from the resulting menu.  Type in the keyword <B>C. Curtis</B>.  Under the optional definition, we might include information about the school, classroom level, and other information that describe the full characteristics of this classroom (although in some circumstances, we would want to implement this information using more keywords.)  When done, click OK to save the keyword.<P>

4. Now add the keyword <B>Geometry by Design</B>, the name of the lesson unit being implemented in this classroom video.  Note that each keyword is added to the database tree as you enter it.<P>
