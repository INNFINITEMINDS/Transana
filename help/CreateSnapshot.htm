If you are using the Standard version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Snapshots are only supported in the Professional, Computer Lab, and Multi-User versions of Transana.<P>

Snapshots are still images that you bring into Transana for analysis.  These images may be independent, or they may be linked to a media file.  They may be loaded from still image files or can be captured from video within Transana.<P>

Transana offers a number of ways of bringing still images into the data analysis process.  We have already discussed <A HREF="insertimage.htm">adding an image to a Document or Transcript</A> as a mechanism for situating a still image in text data or in a media file's transcript.<P>

You can also create free-standing codable images, called Snapshots, for analysis in Transana.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these instructions to create and code a Snapshot from a graphics file in Transana.<P>

1.  Right-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.  Choose "Add Snapshot" from the popup menu.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SnapshotProperties.gif"><P>

2.  To load an image from a graphic file, press the "Browse" button and browse to the directory where you stored the Demonstration Data.  Select the "Transana with Images.jpg" file.  Press <B>Open</B> to confirm the file selection.  Notice that if you have not entered a Snapshot ID, Transana will name the Snapshot after the file name.<P> 

3.  If you want to associate this graphic file with a particular spot in a particular Episode, select the appropriate Library ID, Episode ID, and Transcript ID, then enter the Episode Position and Duration for the Snapshot.  You should be able to determine these values by looking at the Visualization Window's Current Time indicator while working with your Episode.  We'll skip this in the Tutorial.<P>

4.  We need to add some Keywords.  Press the <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"> button to open the Create Keywords in the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group for <B>Snapshot</B>, <B>Whole Snapshot Coding</B>, and <B>Detail Snapshot Coding</B>.  For the <B>Detail Snapshot Coding</B> Keyword, be sure to select a Code Color, the Rectangle for Code Tool, a Line Width, and a Line Style.  When you're done, close the Keyword Management window.<P>

5.  Add the <B>Tutorial : Snapshot</B> and <B>Tutorial : Whole Snapshot Coding</B> Keywords to the Snapshot.  Then press <B>OK</B> to indicate you are done defining the Snapshot Properties.<P>  

<IMG SRC="images/SnapshotWindow4.gif"><P>

6.  Transana now displays the Snapshot in the Snapshot Window, ready for detailed coding.  Press the <IMG SRC="images/EditButton.gif"> &nbsp; button to place the Snapshot into Edit mode so that your upcoming changes will be retained.<P>

7.  The first thing to do is to frame the image properly.  Use a combination of zooming, positioning the image in the frame, and resizing the Snapshot Window to get the image to look exactly the way you want.  We want to emphasize the sculpture shown in this image, reducing the amount of the background shown.<P>

8.  You may notice that the sculpture in this photograph has five legs.  Let's use detailed coding to highlight that aspect of the image.  Select <B>Tutorial</B> as the Keyword Group and <B>Detail Snapshot Coding</B> as the Keyword.  You may notice that the Color, Code Tool, Line Width, and Line Style options update to match those you defined when you edited the selected Keyword, if you specified these values.  You can change these values just for this Snapshot if you want.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SnapshotWindow5.gif"><P>

9.  Select the <IMG SRC="images/codingtool.gif"> Coding Tool from the Toolbar and draw rectangles around the two right front legs of the sculpture.  If you can't draw the coding shape, check to make sure you're in Edit Mode.  If you don't get the line positioned exactly like you want it on your first try, you can always right-click the coding shape and select Delete from the popup menu, then try again.<P>

10.  Note that you can draw as many coding shapes on a Snapshot as you wish.  It's best if each Keyword has a unique comibination of color, shape, line thickness, and line style.  <P>

11.  Leave Edit Mode to save the sizing, positioning, and coding you've done on the Snapshot.  <P>

12.  When you are in Exploration Mode (i.e. when you are NOT in Edit Mode), you can explore your coded Snapshot, including hiding and showing different codes, resizing the image or frame, and so on, without affecting the saved settings of the Snapshot.  Changes are only saved when you are in Edit Mode.<P>

13.  Close the Snapshot Window.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these instructions to create a Snapshot in Transana by capturing a video screen shot.<P>

1.  If it's not already loaded, load the <B>Transana with Media</B> Transcript for the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode.  Click in the Visualization window at about 5:45 in the video so that the Media window shows video of the <B>Add Clip</B> form.<P>

2.  Right-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.  Choose <B>Add Snapshot</B> from the popup menu.<P>

3.  We want to capture a screen shot from the currently loaded and positioned video, press the <IMG SRC="images/SnapshotButton.gif"> &nbsp; <B>Capture Snapshot for Coding</B> button next to the "Browse" button on the Add Snapshot dialog box.  This will call up Transana's Media File Conversion tool.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/ImageCapture2.gif"><p>

4.  When you capture a screen shot to be placed in a Document or Transcript, you do not have to worry about the file name given to that screen shot.  That's because images are actually imported into a Document or Transcript and immediately lose their connection with the source image file.  Snapshots, on the other hand, maintain a connection to the source file, much the same way that Transana's Episodes and Clips maintain a connection to the media file(s) they are connected to.<P>

As a result, you need to change the Destination Media File name on the Media File Conversion form.  This greatly reduces the chances of accidentally over-writing your Snapshot image with a different screen shot from the same media file.  Change the file name from "Transana with Media_Snapshot_%06d.jpg" to "Add Clip Form 1.jpg".  (Transana will automatically append the necessary "_%06d" text to the end of the file name.)  Press "Convert".<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SnapshotWindow3.gif"><P>

5.  Edit the Snapshot ID to read "Add Clip Form 1".  Notice that this Snapshot is automatically connected to the current video position in the Episode from which it was captured.  However, you need to adjust the Episode Position to "5:42.1" and the duration to "43.4" to reflect the time that the "Add Clip" form appears in the video.  Finally, add <B>Tutorial : Clip</B>, <B>Tutorial : Standard Creation Method</B>, and <B>Tutorial : Snapshot</B> as Whole Snapshot Keywords.  Press "OK".<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SnapshotWindow6.gif"><P>

6. You will now see the Snapshot Window, as described in our first example.  Go into <IMG SRC="images/EditButton.gif">&nbsp; Edit mode and code the image as you wish, perhaps zooming in to show only the Add Clip form and adding arrows to code Keywords and other elements of the form.<P>
