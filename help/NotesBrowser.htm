The Notes Browser is a tool designed to help you explore your analytic <A HREF="Notes.htm">Notes</A>.  To open the Notes Browser, open the "Tools" menu and select "Notes Browser."<P>

<IMG SRC="images/NotesBrowser2.gif"><P>

The Notes Browser shows all Notes, divided into categories by the type of Transana data item they are associated with because Notes are often used differently depending on what type of data item they are connected to.<P>

If you select a Note in the Notes tree, that Note is loaded in the <A HREF="Notes.htm">Note editor</A> on the right side of the Notes Browser for editing.  You can insert a time stamp, save a copy of the Note in plain text format, print the note, or search for a word or phrase in the Note text.<P>

If you right-click a Note in the Notes tree, Transana can show you the location of that Note in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A>'s database tree.  You can edit the Note Properties.  If the Note is associated with a <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A>, <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A>, or <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot</A>, you can also load the Quote, Clip, or Snapshot the Note is attached to so that you can see the context for the Note's text.<P>

If you right-click one of the eight root nodes (Library, Document, Episode, Transcript, Collection, Quote, Clip, or Snapshot), you can request a <A HREF="TextReports.htm">Notes report</A> that shows the information and text about all Notes associated with that type of Transana item.  Right-clicking the Database root node allows you to select a Notes report that can include all Notes in your entire database.</A><P>

If you select the Note Search tab, you can type in a word or phrase.  Press the Search button to the right of the Search text box and the Note Search tree shows only those Notes that contain the word or phrase you entered.  If you choose a Notes report from the Note Search tree, the resulting report contains only those notes that contain the Search text you specified.<P>
