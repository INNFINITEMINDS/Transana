The video window allows you to play, pause, and stop the video, and provides a slider bar for navigation within the video.  Note that when you use Pause, the current position in the video is retained, but that when you use Stop, (available in the Windows version only,) the video is automatically rewound to the beginning of the active video segment.  <P>
You can adjust the size of this window by going to the Options Menu, and selecting Video Size, or by dragging the edges of the window.  (On the Macintosh, only the lower right corner of the frame works to resize the frame.)  When you resize the video window, the other three windows automatically adjust their size and position to accommodate the video window size you select if the Auto-Arrange option is selected.<P>
