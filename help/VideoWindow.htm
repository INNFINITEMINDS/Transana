The video window allows you to view one or more media files.  You can play or pause the video, and you can change the position of the video (though not very precisely) using the slider at the bottom of the window.<P>

In the lower right corner of the Video Window, the <IMG SRC="images/snapshoticon.gif">&nbsp; button allows you to capture a screen shot from video files.  (Not all video formats are supported.)  Transana will use the <A HREF="mediaconvert.htm">Media Conversion Tool</A> to create a JPG graphic of the current video frame.  If your current transcript is in Edit mode, the screen shot will also be inserted into your transcript at the current cursor position.<P>

You can adjust the automatic sizing of this window by going to the Options Menu, and selecting Video Size, or by dragging the edges of the window.  (On older versions of OS X, only the lower right corner of the frame works to resize the frame.)  When you resize the video window, the other three windows automatically adjust their size and position to accommodate the video window size you select if the Auto-Arrange option is selected.<P>
