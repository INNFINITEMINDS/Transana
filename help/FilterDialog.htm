Transana's filter dialog allows users to customize the contents of some of Transana's reports.  For example, the image above shows the filter dialog when it is being used for the keyword map.  Depending on which report is using the dialog, it may look different than this.<P>

The Filter dialog may have up to four tabs, an episodes tab for selecting episodes to include in a report, a clips tab for selecting clips to include in a report, a keywords tab for selecting keywords to include, and a time range tab for specifying the scope of a report in terms of a video's time line.  Some, but not all, reports allow the user to alter the order in which episodes, clips, or keywords are displayed in the report.<P>

To include an episode, a clip, or a keyword, make sure the episode, clip, or keyword is checked on the appropriate tab.  To exclude an item, make sure the item is not checked.<P>

To alter the order of items, first click an item to select it, then move that item up or down in the list using the arrow keys on the right side of the dialog box.  If there are no arrows on the right side of the dialog, you cannot control the order of items in the report you are currently customizing.<P>

On the time range tab, you can enter start and end times that control the scope of the report.  This allows you, for example, to zoom in on a keyword map report, so that you can see considerably more detail regarding the placement of keywords in a long video.  Values should be specified in H:M:S.s format, using "20" to indicate 20 seconds, "15:44.6" to indicate 15 minutes and 44.6 seconds, and "1:00:00" to indicate exactly 1 hour.<P>

You can save settings in a filter dialog.  If you want to save or load your settings in a filter dialog, use the first two buttons in the tool bar.  These allow users to easily create customized reports.  Unlike most information in Transana, changes to filter configurations are not automatically saved.  Transana assumes that a saved configuration should not automatically preserve changes, so be sure to press the "Save" button if you intend for changes to a configuration to be permanent.  You can also delete filter configurations using the delete button on the toolbar (the third button).  Please also note that time range data is not saved as part of a filter configuration.<P>

The fourth and fifth buttons on the toolbar allow you to select or deselect all items on a particular tab.  Please note that these buttons affect only the currently selected tab in the filter dialog. <P>
