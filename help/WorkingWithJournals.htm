<H2><I>Working With Research Journals</I><HR></H2>

Research Journals are Documents in Transana where you can record your thoughts about your analytic process and where you can record insights about data.  You can also use them to start your analytic writing. <P>

Transana's Document Window has many of the features one would expect of a basic word processor.  You can edit text, and format it in a variety of ways.  The primary feature that adds real power to Research Journals in Transana is the ability to add hyperlinks to what you are writing.  You can add hyperlinks to Quotes, Clips, Snapshots, and Notes.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>&nbsp; Let's edit a Research Journal and add some hyperlinks.<P>

1.  <A HREF="editdocument.htm">Earlier, you had the opportunity to create a <B>Preliminary Observations and Thoughts</B> Research Journal.</A>  If you didn't create that Document, please do so now.  If you did create that Document, double-click it now to load it in Transana's interface.<P> 

2.  Put the Research Journal in Edit mode and write something in the Research Journal that implies you want to refer to a Quote.<P>

3.  Right-click one of the Quotes in one of your Collections and choose <B>Insert Quote Hyperlink</B> in the menu.  Transana will insert a hyperlink called <B>(Quote link)</B> at the Document's cursor position.  <P>

4.  You can edit text of the hyperlink, but you can't click on the hyperlink to place your cursor in the text because that triggers the hyperlink.  Instead, you have to sneak up to it sideways.  To edit a hyperlink, click next to the link and use the right or left cursor keys to move your cursor into the hyperlink for editing.<P>

5.  Now write something about wanting to create a link to a Clip.  Right-click a Clip and choose <B>Add Clip Hyperlink</B> from the menu.<P>

6.  Add some text about creating a link to a Snapshot.  If you <A HREF="insertsnapshot.htm">Insert a Snapshot</A> into your Research Journal, you will get both a copy of the coded image and a hyperlink to the live Snapshot.  If you want a link to a Snapshot without including the Snapshot itself, just right-click a Snapshot and select <B>Insert Snapshot Hyperlink</B> from the menu.<P>

7.  Last, but certainly not least, write something about creating a link to a Note.  Now right-click a Note in the Database tree and choose <B>Add Note Hyperlink</B>.<P>    

8.  Now click on each of your hyperlinks.  The data item used to trigger the creation of the hyperlink is loaded in each instance.<P>

It's important to note that a Research Journal is just a Document in Transana that you choose to use in a particular analytic way.  That has several important implications.  <P>

<UL>
<LI>That means you can add hyperlinks to ANY Document or Transcript in Transana where you think it would be analytically useful to create a link to a data object.<P></LI>

<LI>It also means you can create Quotes from a Research Journal and code them.<P></LI>

<LI>These hyperlinks will only be available within Transana.  When you export your Document from Transana, the hyperlink will not function in the exported document.<P></LI>

<LI>It's also important to note that hyperlinks are one-way links.  The text with hyperlink knows what data item to connect to.  The data item, however, knows nothing about the hyperlink.  So hyperlinks are not substitutes for Collections or Keywords.  They are primarily intended to be a writing tool.<P></LI>

<LI>If you delete a data item that you have created a hyperlink to, the hyperlink will <I>not</I> be removed from the Document or Transcript.  It won't work any more because there's no longer anything for it to link to, but it will remain in place despite the data item deletion.<P></LI>
