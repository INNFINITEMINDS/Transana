<H2><I>Creating Another Clip</I><HR></H2>

In this part of the tutorial you will create a clip that lacks the appropriate time codes, and you will add a new keyword while creating the clip.  Creating a clip that doesn't fall neatly between existing time codes is a two-step process. First, you insert the time codes you need to delineate the media segment you want to include in the clip. Then you create the clip itself.<P>

If your Sample Transcript for the Sample Video is not currently loaded, you should load it now. Remember, you load a transcript and its associated episode by double-clicking on the transcript item in the database tree in the Data window.  Make sure that the Transcription window is not in Edit mode. If necessary, turn off Edit mode by clicking the Edit button on the Transcription window toolbar. You also need to have time codes visible in the transcript, so if the time codes are hidden, click the time code button on the toolbar to display them.<P>

Starting at 3:34.7, the teacher begins a class discussion of the meaning of the term symmetry.  Your next clip should begin with the statement &quot;Let's talk about that word, symmetrical&quot; and run through the question &quot;What about houses would symmetrical have to do with?&quot; (ending at 3:53.0). We will begin by inserting some time codes on either side of this exchange.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to insert some new time codes: <P>

1. Move the crosshair cursor in the visualization window until you are at 3:34.7 and click as close to that time as possible in the waveform. (Mac users need to click the Visualization window once to make it the active window to be able to see the current time indicator.)  Remember that Transana shows the mouse cursor's time in the field labeled <B>Time:</B> and the current position of the video file in the field labelled "Current:" in the status bar of the Visualization window. (Don't worry if you can only click at 3:34.5 or 3:34.9; just try to get as close as possible.  If precision were required, we could always zoom in on the Visualization window to make the precise selection easier.) Notice that Transana positions the video at 3:34.7 also when you click in the Visualization window.<P>

2. Notice that Transana has highlighted the portion of the transcript where the teacher is reading aloud to the students. This is because this section is surrounded by time codes, which you inserted at the beginning of each change of speaker. (If Transana did not move to the appropriate point in the transcript, you were probably in Edit mode.  Transana does not move the Transcript cursor based on a Waveform selection in Edit Mode, as that would make transcription more difficult.)   <P>

3.  Once you have the video positioned, the next thing you need to do is put the Transcript in Edit mode so that you can insert the time codes you need.  Press the Edit Mode button <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0> in the Transcript Toolbar.  <P>

It is important to note that when Transana is not in Edit Mode, clicking in the waveform changes the video position and moves the highlight in the transcript.  Similarly, clicking in the transcript changes the video position and moves the current position indicator in the waveform.  Clicking in the waveform or the Transcript, when not in Edit Mode, alters the position of the video.  This is useful during analysis of the video, where you want Transana's windows to remain synchronized at all times.  <P>

However, when you are in Edit mode, Transana does not alter the position of the video or the position of the highlight in other windows based on clicks.  This is because when you are trying to edit your transcript and insert time codes, you're trying to get the video position and the cursor in the Transcript to match, and if clicking either window altered the other, this would be impossible.  It sometimes takes new Transana users a little while to get used to this subtlety.<P>

4. You need to unselect the highlighted portion of the transcript, because you are about to enter a new time code, so click anywhere in the transcript to get rid of the selection highlight.<P>

5. Move the cursor in the Transcription window to just before the statement &quot;Let's talk about that word, symmetrical.&quot; And click to position the cursor. <P>

6.  You now need to set the position of the video so that it matches the cursor position in the transcript.  Press <B>Ctrl-S</B>.  This will rewind the video by 2 seconds and start playing it.  You can then press <B>Ctrl-S</B> again when the teacher is finished saying that Amanda asked &quot;What's symmetrical?&quot;  If you aren't happy with the video position, press Ctrl-S and try again.  When the video and transcript positions are correctly lined up, press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code after the word &quot;symmetrical&quot; and before the word &quot;let's.&quot;  <P>

7.  Now press <B>Ctrl-D</B> and let the video play for about 20 seconds, stopping playback with <B>Ctrl-S</B> or <B>Ctrl-D</B> just after the teacher finishes asking what about houses symmetrical would have to do with at 3:53.0.<P>

8.  Move the cursor in the Transcription window to just after the word &quot;with?&quot; in the sentence &quot;What about houses would symmetrical have to do with?&quot; Click to position the cursor, then press <B>Ctrl T</B> to insert another time code, if there's not already one in that position.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Now that we have the time codes we need, follow these directions to create the clip:<P>

1.  Highlight the transcript text between the two time codes that you just inserted, so that your selection runs from approximately 3:34.7 to approximately 3:53.1.<P>

2.  <FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:  </FONT>Click and drag the highlighted text from the Transcript window to the collection called Symmetry in the database tree in the Data window. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:  </FONT>Right-click the Collection where you want to create the Clip (Symmetry) and select &quot;Add Clip&quot;.<P>

Transana opens the <B>Add Clip</B> dialog box.<P>

3.  Enter <B>Houses</B> in the field labeled <B>Clip ID.</B><P>

4.  This clip has a couple of salient points we might want to highlight through coding.  First, it is about the concept of symmetry, which is one of the topics we are exploring in this data set.  Second, it is clear from the video that the student involved in this interchange does not yet understand the concept of symmetry.  (The concept hasn't been taught yet; the teacher is assessing prior knowledge.)  But we don't yet have keywords for either of these concepts.  This is common in qualitative analysis.  Researchers often have not anticipated all the concepts they will wish to tag in their data.<P>

5.  Click the key <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"  ALT="keywordicon"   BORDER=0> icon in the Add Clip dialog box. Transana opens the <B>Keyword Management</B> dialog box.  This will allow us to add the keywords we need.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagement.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagement"   BORDER=0><P>

6.  Click <B>Add Keyword to List</B>. Transana opens the <B>Add Keyword</B> dialog box.<P>

7. In the field labeled <B>Keyword</B>, enter <B>Symmetry</B>. It is a good idea to enter a short definition in the field labeled <B>Definition</B>. Click <B>OK </B>when you are done.  Repeat this process to add the keyword <B>Confusion</B>, defined as expressing a lack of understanding of a concept.<P>

8. Click <B>Close</B> to leave the <B>Keyword Management</B> dialog box.<P>

9. Double-click the keyword <B>Symmetry</B> and <B>Confusion</B> in the <B>Keyword</B> field of the <B>Add Clip</B> dialog box so that the keywords are added to the Clip Keywords box.  Then click <B>OK</B> to leave this dialog box.<P>

10.  The final step in creating a clip is to create the analytic memo that describes it.  Right-click the <B>Houses</B> clip and choose <B>Add Clip Note</B>.  Name your note <B>Houses Clip Purpose</B>, enter your initials as Note Taker, and press <B>OK</B>.<P>

11.  Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to date/time stamp your note and describe the reason you created a clip from this segment of video, any analytic insights you have as a result of this clip, and any future research ideas this clip has spawned in your brain.  When you're done, close the note.<P>
