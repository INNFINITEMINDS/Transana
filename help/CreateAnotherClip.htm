<H2><I>Create Another Clip<HR ></I></H2><P>
In this part of the tutorial, you add another clip, and create a new keyword. If your Sample Transcript for the Sample Video is not currently loaded, you should load it now. Remember, you load a transcript and its associated episode by double-clicking on the transcript item in the database tree in the Data window.<P>
Make sure that the Transcription window is not in Edit mode. If necessary, turn off Edit mode by clicking the Edit button on the Transcription window toolbar. You also need to have time codes visible in the transcript, so if the time codes are hidden, click the time code button on the toolbar to display them.<P>
In this part of the tutorial you create a clip that lacks the appropriate time codes. Creating this kind of clip is a two-step process. First, you must insert time codes before and after the text you want to make a clip. Then you have to create the clip itself.<P>
Starting at 3:34.7, the teacher begins a discussion of symmetry with the class.  Your next clip should begin with the statement &quot;Let's talk about that word, symmetrical&quot; and run through the question &quot;What about houses would symmetrical have to do with?&quot; (ending at 3:53.0). Begin by inserting some time codes on either side of this exchange.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to insert some new time codes: <P>
1. Move the crosshair cursor in the visualization window until you are at 3:34.7 and click as close to that time as possible in the waveform. Remember that Transana shows the time in the field labeled <B>Time:</B> in the status bar of the Visualization window. (Don't worry if you can only click at 3:34.5 or 3:34.9; just try to get as close as possible.  If precision were required, we could always zoom in on the Visualization Window to make the precise selection easier.) Notice that Transana positions the video at 3:34.7 also.<P>
2. Notice that Transana has highlighted the portion of the transcript where the teacher is reading aloud to the students. This is because this section is surrounded by time codes, which you inserted at the beginning of each change of speaker. (If Transana did not move to the appropriate point in the transcript, you were probably in Edit mode.  Transana does not move the Transcript cursor based on a Waveform selection in Edit Mode, as that makes transcription more difficult.)   <P>
3.  Once you have the video positioned, the next thing you need to do is put the Transcript in Edit mode so that you can insert the time code.  Press the Edit Mode button <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>.  <P>
It is important to note that when Transana is not in Edit Mode, clicking in the waveform changes the video position and moves the highlight in the transcript.  Similarly, clicking in the transcript changes the video position and moves the highlight in the waveform.  Clicking in the Waveform or the Transcript, when not in Edit Mode, alters the position of the video.  This is useful during analysis of the video, where you want Transana's windows to remain synchronized at all times.  <P>
However, when you are in Edit mode, Transana does not alter the position of the video or the position of the highlight in other windows based on clicks.  This is because when you are trying to edit your transcript and insert time codes, you're trying to get the video position and the cursor in the Transcript to match, and if clicking either window altered the other, this would be impossible.  This distinction is admittedly rather subtle, and is something that new Transana users sometimes struggle with until they get used to it.<P>
4. You need to unselect the highlighted portion of the transcription, because you are about to enter a new time code, so click anywhere in the unhighlighted portion of the transcription.<P>
5. Move the cursor in the Transcription window to just before the statement &quot;Let's talk about that word, symmetrical.&quot; And click to position the cursor. <P>
6.  If you want to confirm the position of the video, press <B>Ctrl-S</B>.  This will rewind the video by 2 seconds and start playing it.  You can then press <B>Ctrl-S</B> again when the teacher is finished saying that Amanda asked &quot;What's symmetrical?&quot;  Then press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code before the word &quot;let's.&quot;  <P>
7.  Now press <B>Ctrl-D</B> and let the video play for about 20 seconds, stopping playback with <B>Ctrl-S</B> or <B>Ctrl-D</B> just after the teacher finishes asking what about houses symmetrical would have to do with at 3:53.0.<P>
8.  Move the cursor in the Transcription window to just after the word &quot;with?&quot; in the sentence &quot;What about houses would symmetrical have to do with?&quot; Click to position the cursor, then press <B>Ctrl T</B> to insert another time code, if there's not already one in that position.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create the clip:<P>
1.  Highlight the transcription text between these two time codes that you just inserted.<P>
2.  <FONT COLOR="Red">Windows-only Alternative:  </FONT>Click and drag the highlighted text from the Transcript Window to the collection called Symmetry in the database tree in the Data window. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh or Windows Alternative:  </FONT>Right-click the Collection where you want to create the Clip (Symmetry) and select &quot;Add Clip&quot;.<P>
Transana opens the <B>Add Clip</B> dialog box.<P>
3.  Enter <B>Houses</B> in the field labeled <B>Clip ID.</B><P>
4.  Look in the field called <B>Clip Keywords </B>for the keyword Symmetry. If it's not already there, apply the keyword &quot;Symmetry&quot; to this clip by double-clicking on <B>Symmetry</B> in the <B>Keyword</B> list.<P>
5.  It is clear from the video that the student named Paul does not understand the concept of symmetry at this point, and you should indicate that in your keywords.  You don't yet have a keyword that describes that, so you should add one now. Click the key <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"  ALT="keywordicon"   BORDER=0> icon in the Add Clip dialog box. Transana opens the <B>Keyword Management</B> dialog box.<P>
<IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagement.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagement"   BORDER=0><P>
6.  Click <B>Add Keyword to List</B>. Transana opens the <B>Add Keyword</B> dialog box.<P>
7. In the field labeled <B>Keyword</B>, enter <B>Confusion</B>. If you want, enter a short definition in the field labeled <B>Definition</B>. Click <B>OK </B>when you are done.<P>
8. Click <B>Close</B> to leave the <B>Keyword Management</B> dialog box.<P>
9. Double-click <B>Confusion</B> in the <B>Keyword</B> field of the <B>Add Clip</B> dialog box. Then click <B>OK</B> to leave this dialog box.<P>
