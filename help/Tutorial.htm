<H2><I>Welcome to the Transana Tutorial<HR ></I></H2><P>
This tutorial teaches you how to use Transana for video transcription and qualitative analysis. It supplements the <A HREF="mainpage.htm">Transana Manual</A>, which was installed with Transana at the same time this Tutorial was installed.  <P>
In this tutorial, you use a sample video of a classroom lesson to perform the following tasks:
<UL><LI>Create keywords that are used in later analysis.<P>
<LI>Add the sample video to Transana's database, making it available for transcription and analysis.<P>
<LI>Transcribe the sample video.<P>
<LI>Add time codes to allow synchronization between the video and the transcript.<P>
<LI>Define clips, which are portions of a video that are analytically interesting.<P>
<LI>Search clips using Transana's Search Interface.<P>
<LI>Look at several of the reports Transana can generate.<P>
<LI>Learn a little about how to use Transana during presentations.</UL><P>
Note that Transana requires full screen operation at all times. This means that you will need to switch back and forth between the Tutorial and the Transana program. To do this, just click on the Transana button on the Windows task bar or Macintosh dock to go to Transana and click on the &quot;Help&quot; or &quot;TransanaHelp&quot; button in the task bar or dock to restore the tutorial.  <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>The tutorial uses this icon to help you easily identify tasks that you should perform in the tutorial. If a task has multiple steps, you might want to print the page so that you can remember them if the tutorial is minimized. To print a page, click the print icon on the Tutorial toolbar.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Microsoft Windows Activity: </FONT>or <FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh Activity: </FONT>If a procedure is specific to Microsoft Windows or the Macintosh, the tutorial uses an icon like this to differentiate between procedures. However, it's very rare for procedures to differ. The most notable differences are in the creation of Clips and that Mac users who have a single-button mouse should Control-click instead of right-click in the Data Window. Mac users who have a two-button mouse can use right-click. At the beginning of this tutorial you are reminded of this difference; as you progress through the activities, the reminder is omitted.<P>
