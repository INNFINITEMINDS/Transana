<H1>Program Settings</H1><HR>

There are several tabs under Program Settings:<P>

The <B>Directories Tab</B> allows you to specify the folders on your system where Transana should store different types of program data. <P>

The <B>Video Root Directory</B> allows a user to define a common starting point for all media files to be analyzed with Transana.  This is useful for people who need to copy data between different computers, such as a desktop and a laptop, for example.  The desktop may specify a network location where all video is stored, while the laptop may need to point to a local hard drive where only a subset of the video is available because of storage limitations.  In such a situation, the Video Root Directory on Desktop might be N:\ProjectName\Video, while on the laptop it might be C:\Video.  As long as video files are arranged in the same directory hierarchy from the video root directories, Transana is able to find the appropriate video on all systems that use the Video Root properly.  This setting is vital for users of Transana's multi-user version in cross-platform environments, where different computers may refer to the same video location in different ways.  <P>

The <B>Waveform Directory</B> tells Transana where to look for and store the extracted audio files it creates as part of drawing waveform diagrams.  If there are multiple computers sharing the same video files, sharing waveforms can reduce the overall time spent on audio extraction, as only the first user needs to complete this process.<P>

The <B>Database Directory</B> setting allows you to specify the location of your database files.  You should store your database somewhere where it will be backed up regularly.  When you change this setting, you must quit and restart Transana before the change will take effect.  (This setting is not available on the multi-user version of Transana, where a database server is selected during program startup instead.)<P>

The <B>Transcriber Settings Tab</B> allows you to control settings that are used during transcription.<P>

Within the Transcript Window, the Ctrl-S key combination can be used to start and stop video playback while you are transcribing your video.  The video is automatically rewound a small amount before it is played to ease the transcription process.  The <B>Transcription Setback</B> setting allows you to specify the amount of rewind, from 0 to 5 seconds, used in this situation.  <P>

On Windows, prior to Windows Vista, users may select which version of Windows Media Player will be used with appropriate media files using the <B>Media Player Selection</B> option.  One of the Windows Media Players options allows users to control video playback speed for most formats but does not support most WMV and WMA format media files, while the other Windows Media Player option supports more media types but does not support Transana's playback speed option for as many formats.  Users on Windows Vista and Windows 7 are not given a choice, as there is only one version of Windows Media Player available on that version of Windows.  (Vista users who need to control playback speed should use WMV, MOV or MP4 video formats, which allow speed change.  Other formats may or may not.)  Macintosh users also do not have the media player selection option, and can change playback speed with all supported media formats.<P>

<B>Video Playback Speed</B> can be changed with the second slider, and can range from 1/10<SUP>th</SUP> normal speed to twice normal speed, (unless this option is over-ridden by the Media Player Selection.)  This allows you to adjust the playback speed to match your typing abilities, and allows more careful analysis of quick events in your media files, such as rapid animal behaviors.<P>

You can set the <B>tab size</B> used in the transcript window (in characters). You can set the <B>default font</B> and <B>font size</B> for new transcripts on this tab.  (These two settings have no effect on existing transcripts.)  Finally, you can disable word wrap.  These settings are particularly useful when trying to use spaces and tabs for horizontal formatting and indentation.<P>

Transana-MU, the multi-user version, has an additional tab under Program Settings, the <B>MU Message Server Tab</B>.  If you are not using the multi-user version of Transana, you can ignore the rest of this help page.<P>

Did you know that when you do something that changes the Database tab in the Data Window, all other users sharing the same database see your change instantly and automatically?  This is possible because of the Transana-MU Message Server.  <P>

The MU Message Server Tab within Program Settings allows you to specify the name of the server where your copy of the Transana Message Server is running, and the port number it is running on.  There is no default server name (we have no idea what server yours will be installed on), but the default port number is 17595.  <I><B>Please note that all Transana-MU instances working with the same data set need to connect to the same Transana-MU Message Server.</B></I><P>
