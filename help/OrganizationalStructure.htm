Transana is designed to allow researchers to work with large collections of video. It provides various tools and metaphors for organizing, analyzing, and retrieving videos, segments of videos, and transcriptions of videos. It also allows you to link a transcription to a video so that you can move seamlessly through both at the same time.<P>
Each of your original video files is represented in Transana's database as an <B>episode</B>.  An episode entry in the Transana database contains information about a single digital video file.  You group episodes into <B>series; </B>series describe the logical connection among sets of episodes.  <P>
The same structure is followed in the analysis portion of Transana.  The basic unit of analysis is the <B>clip</B>, which is a portion of an episode that you identify as analytically interesting.  Clips are organized into thematic <B>collections</B>.  Your collection structure reflects the theoretical structure of your qualitative analysis.<P>
Clips are flagged for complex analysis through the assignment of <B>keywords</B>.  A keyword is a term that you define that represents a concept that you want to study.  Clips can have multiple keywords. Keywords are organized into <B>keyword groups</B>.  Your keyword structure also reflects the theoretical structure of your qualitative analysis.<P>
