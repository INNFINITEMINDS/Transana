<H2><I>Transana's Organizational Structure</I><HR></H2>

Transana is designed to allow researchers to work with large collections of media files. It provides various tools and metaphors for organizing, analyzing, and retrieving media files, segments of media files, and transcriptions of media files. It also allows you to link a transcription to a media file so that you can move seamlessly through both at the same time.<P>

Each of your original media files is represented in Transana's database as an <B>episode</B>.  An episode entry in the Transana database contains information about a single digital media file.  You group episodes into <B>series</B>; series describe the logical connection among sets of episodes.  <B>The <I>Series</I> node in Transana is where you organize your <I>raw</I> media data</B>.<P>

The basic unit of analysis in Transana is the <B>clip</B>, which is a portion of an episode that you identify as analytically meaningful.  Clips are organized into thematic <B>collections</B>.  With time, your collection structure will likely reflect the theoretical understanding of your data you develop through your qualitative analysis.  <B><I>Analytic</I> data, extracted from raw data, falls under the <I>Collections</I> node within Transana</B>.<P>

Clips are flagged for complex analysis through the assignment of <B>keywords</B>.  A keyword is a term that you define that represents a concept that you want to represent within your data or study.  Clips can have multiple keywords. Keywords are organized into <B>keyword groups</B>.  Your keyword structure also reflects the theoretical structure of your qualitative analysis.  <B>Your <I>coding</I> structure is developed under the <I>Keywords</I> node within Transana</B>.<P>
