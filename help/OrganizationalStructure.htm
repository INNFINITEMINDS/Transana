<H2><I>Transana's Organizational Structure</I><HR></H2>

Transana is designed to allow researchers to work with large collections of data files. It provides various tools and metaphors for organizing, analyzing, and retrieving data, analytically important segments of these files, and transcripts associated with media files. <P>

<B>The <I>Library</I> node in Transana is where you organize your <i>source</I> or <I>raw</I> text and media data</B> in Transana.  Each of your original text files is imported as a <B>Document</B> in Transana, and each of your source media files is represented in Transana as an <B>Episode</B>.  An Episode contains a media file, (or can contain more than one overlapping media file, as from multiple cameras recording the same events,) and can be associated with one or more <B>Transcripts</B> that are linked to the media file contents.  You group related Documents and Episodes into <B>Libraries</B>; the Library describes the logical connection among sets of Documents and Episodes.  <P>

<B><I>Analytic</I> data, extracted from raw data, falls under the <I>Collections</I> node within Transana</B>.  The basic units of analysis in Transana are the <B>Quote</B> for text, the <B>Clip</B> for media data, and the <B>Snapshot</B> for still image data.  Quotes and Clips are portions of Documents and Episodes that you identify as analytically meaningful.  Snapshots represent still image data you bring into your analysis.  Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots are organized into thematic <B>Collections</B>.  With time, your Collection structure will likely reflect the theoretical understanding of your data you develop through your qualitative analysis.  The Collection containging a Quote, Clip, or Snapshot indicates one aspect of what is analytically  significance about that Quote, Clip, or Snapshot.<P>

<B>Your <I>coding</I> structure is developed under the <I>Keywords</I> node within Transana</B>.  Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots can be coded through the assignment of <B>Keywords</B>.  A Keyword is a label that you define that represents a concept that you want to represent within your data or study.  Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots can have multiple Keywords. Keywords are organized into <B>Keyword Groups</B>.  Your Keyword structure can also reflect the theoretical structure of your qualitative analysis.  <P>
