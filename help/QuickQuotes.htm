<H2><I>Text - Quick Quotes</I><HR></H2>

We now have a Collection of Standard Quotes and Clips that show several different methods for creating Standard Quotes from Documents and Standard Clips from Episodes.  Standard Quote and Clip creation requires naming the data item and choosing a (presumably) analytically meaningful Collection in which to create it.<P>

Transana provides an alternate method of creating Quotes called <I>Quick Quotes</I>. Quick Quotes are fast and easy to create, and are designed to allow coding of text without requiring as much analytic thought up front.  You can quickly apply coding to text and figure out later what the coding means.<P>

Let's explore the process of creating Quick Quotes.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT><P>

<A HREF="analysisoverview.htm">As mentioned earlier</A>, Quick Quotes are Keyword-oriented Quotes, while Standard Quotes are Collection-oriented Quotes.  In the same way that we had to <A HREF="createcollection.htm">create a Collection</A> before we could <A HREF="createquotes.htm">create a Standard Quote</A>, we need to <A HREF="createkeywords.htm">create a Keyword</A> before we can create a Quick Quote.<P>

1.  If the <B>Transana with Text</B> Document is not currently loaded, load it by double-clicking it in the Data window's Database Tree.<P>

2. Scroll down to the <B>Quick Quotes</B> section of the Document.  The first couple of paragraphs talk about creating a Keyword, which we have already done.  Locate the sentence that says, "You can double-click the Keyword you'd like to code your Quick Quote with to trigger Quick Quote creation."  Highlight that sentence.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/demodocument3.gif"><P>

3.  Now double-click the <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword.  That's it.  You've created a Quick Quote, matching the text selected in your Document with the Keyword you double-clicked.<P>

Let's take a closer look.  In the Collections node of the Database Tree, you will now find a <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection.  If this Collection doesn't already exist, Transana creates it automatically.  (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font>  Transana automatically appends your user name onto the <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection to differentiate between the items created by different users.)<P>

Assuming this is the first Quick Quote you created from this Document, you will find a Quote in the <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection called <B>Transana with Text Quick Quote 1</B>.  Transana takes the name of the Document and automatically names and numbers the Quick Quote.<P>   

Double-click the new Quick Quote so it opens in a new tab in the Document window.  You will see just the selected text.  Looking in the Visualization Window or at the Keywords Tab in the Data Window, you will see that the Quick Quote has the <B>Tutorial : Document</B> Keyword, which it inherited from the Document coding and the <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword, which you used to trigger the Quick Quote creation.  (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font> Transana will also assign your user name to the Quick Quote as a Keyword, creating a Keyword Group called "Transana Users" and adding your user name to that group if necessary.)<P>

4.  Click back into the <B>Transana with Text</B> Document by selecting the correct tab in the Document window.  Without moving your selection in the Document, double-click the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword.  Transana will add additional Keywords to your existing Quick Quote, rather than creating a new, duplicate Quick Quote, when you signal the creation of another Quick Quote without changing your text selection.  A single Quote with multiple Keywords is analytically more useful than multiple identical-text Quotes with one Keyword each.<P>  

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create another Quick Quote.<P>

1.  Click somewhere in the next sentence, without making a selection, the sentence that reads, "Right-click the Keyword and choose "Create Quick Quote" from the menu.'<P>

2.  Right-click the <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword and choose "Create Quick Quote" from the menu.  You should notice that a new Quote appears in the Data Window's <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection with coding reflected in the Visualization Window.<P>    

3.  Without changing your text selection, right-click the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword and choose <B>Create Quick Quote</B> to add this Keyword to the existing Quick Quote.  You will notice that no new Quote is created, but the coding is added to the Visualization Window after a moment.<P> 

4.  If you double-click the newest Quote to load it in a new tab in the Document Window, you will notice Transana selected the sentence surrounding your cursor since you did not make a selection in the Document.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create another Quick Quote.<P>

1.  Highlight the first sentence of the next paragraph, which says "Drag the selected text from the Document and drop it on the target Keyword."<P>

2.  Drag the selected text from the Document to the Data Window and drop the text on the <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword to create a new Quick Quote.  Grab the text again and drag it to the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword to add the additional Keyword to the Quote.<P>   

If you want to create a series of Quick Quotes with the same Keyword, highlight the desired Keyword in the Database Tree.  Then, for each selection you make in the Document, you can press Ctrl-K or the <B>Create Quick Quote or Clip</B> button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"> &nbsp;in the Document Toolbar to create the desired Quick Quotes.<P>

At this point, you may wish to create a Collection Note (or multiple Quote Notes if you prefer) covering the analytic memo information for the Quick Quotes you just created.  <P>
