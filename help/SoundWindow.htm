<H1>Visualization Window</H1><HR>

Transana's visualization window shows a variety of visual representations of information about your data along the timeline of your media file.  You can select the visualization you would like to use in the Options menu under Visualization Style.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/soundwindow.gif"  ALT="Waveform Visualization"   BORDER=0><P>

The <B>waveform visualization</B> displays a waveform, a visual representation of the intensity of the audio track for a given piece of video.  This visual representation can be extremely useful during transcription for precise navigation within a video.  The waveform also facilitates the process of inserting <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> accurately.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/KeywordVisualization.gif" ALT="Keyword Visualization" BORDER=0><P>

The <B>keyword visualization</B> shows you the coding you have applied to your video.  This can be very useful during analysis to see how you have applied keywords to your episode as a whole.  The <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A>'s selected keywords tab allows you to determine what clips are associated with the coding at a particular position in the keyword visualization.  Hold your mouse over a colored band to see which keyword the band represents.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/HybridVisualization.gif" ALT="Hybrid Visualization" BORDER=0><P>

The <B>hybrid visualization</B> shows both waveform and keyword information.<P>

To change between visualizations, go to the Options menu, Visualization Style item, and select the visualization you want from the submenu.<P>

The keyword and hybrid visualizations can be customized.  Click the <B>filter dialog</B> button (<IMG SRC="images/FilterButton.gif" ALT="Filter" BORDER=0>) to load the visualization <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">filter dialog</A> box.  In this dialog, you can specify which clips, snapshots, and keywords to include or exclude from the visualization, as well as the color associated with each keyword.  You can also customize the size of the bars and the amount of whitespace that appears between bars.<P>

Click on a spot in the visualization window to position the media file to the corresponding location.  The visualization window's status bar gives you precise information about the position of the media cursor in the media file.<P>

You can alter your current position in the media file very precisely by pressing the cursor right and cursor left keys.  The amount the video moves depends on several things.  If you press the cursor left or cursor right key, the visualization cursor moves one pixel in the direction indicated.  How much time this represents in the media file depends on how long your media file is, how large the visualization window is on your screen, and whether or not you have zoomed in on a portion of the visualization.  <P>

Another alternative is to hold down a modifier key (Shift, Alt, or Ctrl) when using the cursor key, which causes the media file to shift a specific time amount.  If you are holding the Shift key when you press the cursor key, the media file moves in one-second increments.  If you are holding the Alt key, the media file moves in 1/2-second increments.  If you hold the Ctrl key on Windows and both the Command and Ctrl keys on OS X, the media file moves 1/29.97th of a second, or exactly one frame in a normal NTSC video file.<P>

Right-clicking the visualization window causes the media file to play or pause, starting from the selected position.  You can drag in the visualization window with your mouse to select a segment of the media file, to set both a start and stop point for playback.  (Alternately, you can click in the waveform to indicate a starting point and hold down the Shift key while clicking a second time to indicate an ending point to make a selection.)<P>

You can zoom in and out on the waveform using the zoom buttons with the magnifying glass icons in the lower left-hand corner of the visualization window.  To zoom in, highlight the portion of the waveform you would like to examine more closely and press the <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif"  ALT="zoomin"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button.  If you zoom in several levels in this way, the <IMG SRC="images/zoomout.gif"  ALT="zoomout"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button will back you out in the same stages you zoomed in with.  You can also press the &quot;100%&quot; marker at any time to return the waveform to its original size.<P>

The looping button <IMG SRC="images/loopbutton.gif" ALT="Looping"> &nbsp;allows you to play a section of your media file in a loop, which can be very helpful during transcription.  You can make a selection in the visualization window (zooming in for greater precision) and that selection will loop when you press the looping button.  If you do not make a specific selection, a 5 second segment starting at the current media position will loop.  Pressing the looping button again is the only way to stop the looping process.  Other methods of stopping media playback do not work when looping is in effect.<P>
