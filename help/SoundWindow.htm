<H1>Visualization Window<HR ></H1><P>
Transana's visualization window shows a variety of visual representations of information about your data along the timeline of your media file.  You can select the visualization you would like to use in the Options menu under Visualization Style.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/soundwindow.gif"  ALT="Waveform Visualization"   BORDER=0><P>

The waveform visualization displays a waveform, a visual representation of the intensity of the audio track for a given piece of video.  This visual representation can be extremely useful during transcription for precise navigation within a video.  The waveform also facilitates the process of inserting <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> accurately.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/KeywordVisualization.gif" ALT="Keyword Visualization" BORDER=0><P>

The keyword visualization shows you the coding you have applied to your video.  This can be very useful during analysis to see how you have applied keywords to your episode as a whole.  The data window's selected keywords tab allows you to determine what clips are associated with the coding at a particular position in the keyword visualization.  Hold your mouse over a colored band to see which keyword the band represents.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/HybridVisualization.gif" ALT="Hybrid Visualization" BORDER=0><P>

The hybrid visualization shows both waveform and keyword information.<P>

The keyword and hybrid visualizations can be customized.  Click the filter dialog button (<IMG SRC="images/FilterButton.gif" ALT="Filter" BORDER=0>) to load the visualization <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">filter dialog</A> box.  In this dialog, you can specify which keywords to include or exclude from the visualization, as well as setting the color associated with each keyword and the size of the bars and the amount of whitespace that appears between bars.<P>

Click on a spot in the visualization window to position the video to the corresponding location.  The visualization window's status bar gives you precise information about the position of the media cursor in the video.<P>

You can alter the position of the video very precisely by pressing the cursor right and cursor left keys.  The amount the video moves depends on several things.  If you press the cursor left or cursor right key, the visualization cursor moves one pixel in the direction indicated.  How much time this represents in the video depends on how long your video file is, how large the visualization window is on your screen, and whether or not you have zoomed in on a portion of the visualization.  <P>

Another alternative is to hold down a modifier key (Shift, Alt, or Ctrl) when using the cursor key, which causes the video to shift a specific time amount.  If you are holding the Shift key when you press the cursor key, the video moves in one-second increments.  If you are holding the Alt key, the video moves in 1/2-second increments.  If you hold the Ctrl key, the video moves 1/29.97th of a second, or exactly one frame in a normal video file.<P>

Right-clicking the visualization window causes the video to play or pause, starting from the selected position.  You can drag in the visualization window with your mouse to select a segment of video to select both a start and stop point for playback.  (Alternately, you can click in the waveform to indicate a starting point and hold down the Shift key while clicking a second time to indicate an ending point to make a selection.)<P>

You can zoom in and out on the waveform using the zoom buttons with the magnifying glass icons in the lower left-hand corner of the visualization window.  To zoom in, highlight the portion of the waveform you would like to examine more closely and press the <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif"  ALT="zoomin"   BORDER=0> button.  If you zoom in several levels in this way, the <IMG SRC="images/zoomout.gif"  ALT="zoomout"   BORDER=0> button will back you out in the same stages you zoomed in with.  You can also press the &quot;100%&quot; marker at any time to return the waveform to its original size.<P>
