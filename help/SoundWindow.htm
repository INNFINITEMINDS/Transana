The sound visualization window displays a waveform, which is a bitmap representation of the audio track for a given piece of video.  This visual representation can be extremely useful for precise navigation within a video.  The waveform facilitates the process of inserting <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> accurately.<P>

Clicking on a spot in the visualization window positions the video to the corresponding location.  The visualization window's status bar gives you precise information about the position of the media cursor in the video.<P>

You can alter the position of the video very precisely by pressing the cursor right and cursor left keys.  The amount the video moves depends on several things.  If you press the cursor left or cursor right key, the visualization cursor will move one pixel in the direction indicated.  How much time this represents in the video depends on how long your video file is, how large the visualization window is on your screen, and whether or not you have zoomed in on a portion of the visualization.  <P>

Another alternative is to hold down a modifier key (Shift, Alt, or Ctrl) when using the cursor key, which causes the video to shift a specific time amount.  If you are holding the Shift key when you press the cursor key, the video will move in one second increments.  If you are holding the Alt key, the video will move in 1/2 second increments.  If you hold the Ctrl key, the video will move 1/29.97th of a second, or exactly one frame in a normal video file.<P>

Right-clicking the visualization window causes the video to play or pause, starting from the selected position.  You can drag in the visualization window with your mouse to select a segment of video to select both a start and stop point for playback.  (Alternately, you can click in the waveform to indicate a starting point and hold down the Shift key while clicking a second time to indicate an ending point to make a selection.)<P>

You can zoom in and out on the waveform using the zoom buttons with the magnifying glass icons in the lower left-hand corner of the visualization window.  To zoom in, highlight the portion of the wave form you would like to examine more closely and press the <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif"  ALT="zoomin"   BORDER=0> button.  If you zoom in several levels in this way, the <IMG SRC="images/zoomout.gif"  ALT="zoomout"   BORDER=0> button will back you out in the same stages you zoomed in with.  You can also press the &quot;100%&quot; marker at any time to return the WaveForm to its original size.<P>
