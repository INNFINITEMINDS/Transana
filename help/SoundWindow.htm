The sound visualization window displays a waveform, or a bitmap representation of the audio track for a given piece of video.  We have found that this visual represenation can be extremely useful for precise navigation within a video, which facilitates the process of inserting <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> accurately.<P>
Clicking on the visualization window positions the video.  Right-clicking the visualization window causes the video to play or pause, starting from the selected position.  You can drag in the visualization window with your mouse to select a segment of video that becomes the active segment.  The visualization window's status bar gives you precise information about the position in the video of the media cursor.<P>
You can zoom in and out on the waveform using the zoom buttons with the magnifying glass icons in the lower left-hand corner of the visualization window.  To zoom in, highlight the portion of the wave form you would like to examine more closely and press the <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif"  ALT="zoomin"   BORDER=0> button.  If you zoom in several levels in this way, the <IMG SRC="images/zoomout.gif"  ALT="zoomout"   BORDER=0> button will back you out in the same stages you zoomed in with.  You can also press the &quot;100%&quot; marker at any time to return the WaveForm to its original size.<P>
