Transana offers a number of ways of bringing still images into the data analysis process.  One option is to add a still image to the transcript.  These still images might be in the form of data files, from photographs or scans for example, or could be screen shots captured from a video file.  (Snapshots are another option for bringing still images into Transana for users with the Professional, Multi-user, and Computer Lab versions of Transana, but we will discuss <A HREF="createsnapshot.htm">Snapshots</A> later in the Tutorial.)<p>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these instructions to import an image from a file into a Transcript or Document.<P>

1.  Make sure the <B>Transana with Media</B> Transcript for the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode is loaded.  (We could also use the <B>Transana with Text</B> document, but the document already has embedded images.)<P>

2.  Make sure the Transcript is in edit mode.  You cannot make changes to a Document or Transcript that is in read-only mode.<P>

3.  Place your cursor at the of the sentence that reads "To do this, right-click the Library's root node in the Database Tree, and choose 'Add Library' from the menu," which ends at 43.5 seconds into the media file.  Press enter a couple of times so there is a blank line in the Transcript and place the cursor on that blank line.<P>

4.  Go to the Document menu in Transana's main menu and select the "Insert Image" menu item.<P>

5.  Browse to the directory where you saved the Demonstration Data and select the "LibraryProperties.gif" file.  Press "Open".<P>

The image file will be inserted into the Transcript or Document at the cursor position.  Please note that the size of the Document window affects the size of the image when it is imported, so for larger images you may want to manipulate the size of the Document Window prior to inserting images.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these instructions to capture a screen shot from a video file and place it in a Transcript or Document.<P>

1.  Make sure the transcript is in Edit mode.<P>

2.  Locate the portion of the transcript that says "If you have not yet assigned an Episode ID, the file name will automatically be suggested as the Episode's ID."  Left-click within that sentence, then right-click within the Transcript to have Transana play this segment of the Transcript.  The media file will automatically stop at the spot corresponding to the time code at the end of this sentence.<P>

3.  To avoid over-writing the highlighted sentence in the Transcript, click at the beginning of this sentence so the highlight disappears, then press Enter twice to create a blank line.  Place the Transcript cursor on the blank line.<P>

4.  Press the <IMG SRC="images/SnapshotButton.gif"> &nbsp; "Capture Snapshot" button <B>on the Media window</b>.  Transana's Media File Conversion dialog will be displayed.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/ImageCapture1.gif"><P>

5.  Press the "Convert" button.  It may take a moment for Transana to process the screen capture request.  (The further into the file, the longer this process may take in some media formats.)<P>

<IMG SRC="images/ImageInTranscript.gif"><P>

You can now see the screen capture of the video file displayed in the Transcript.<P>

It is important to recognize that you have the video available at all times within Transana, so you should be careful not to over-use this screen-capture feature.  Adding images to transcripts can be a very powerful way of bringing the visual into your analysis, but it can also slow down editing Documents and Transcripts and can make the process of creating Quotes and Clips slower.  <P>
