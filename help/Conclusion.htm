We hope this tutorial has been helpful to you.  It has introduced a number of Transana's features, and has explained some of the analytic power that the program offers.  We hope you find Transana to be a useful and powerful tool in your analysis of video data. <P>

Transana provides more features and controls than can be covered in a tutorial. Use the help system to discover more features, or to explore those that you still find confusing. <P>

The Transana Web site (http://www.transana.org) is an excellent resource when you have questions.  The Program Support section includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section, additional documentation (includling "ScreenCasts" which demonstrate common analytic tasks,) and the User Forums where Transana users ask questions and find answers about the use of the program.<P>

Good luck with your analyses.<P>
