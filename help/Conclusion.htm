We hope this tutorial has been helpful to you.  It has introduced a number of Transana's features, and has explained some of the analytic power that the program offers.  We hope you find Transana to be a useful and powerful tool in your analysis of video data. <P>
Transana provides more features and controls than can be covered in a tutorial. Use the help system to discover more features, or to explore those that you still find confusing. <P>
If you have general questions, the best source for information about the use of Transana is the Program Support section of the Transana Web site.  The URL is http://www.transana.org.<P>
Good luck with your analyses.<P>
