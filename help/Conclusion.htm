We hope this tutorial has been helpful to you.  It has introduced most of Transana's features, and has explained much of the analytic power that the program offers.  We hope you find Transana to be a useful and powerful tool in your analysis of text, still image, and media data. <P>

Transana provides more features and controls than can be covered in a tutorial. Use the help system to discover more features, or to explore those that you still find confusing. <P>

The Transana Web site (http://www.transana.org) is an excellent resource when you have questions.  The Program Support section includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section, additional documentation (includling "ScreenCasts" which demonstrate common analytic tasks,) and a Contact form where you can ask questions of Transana's development team.<P>

Good luck with your analyses.<P>
