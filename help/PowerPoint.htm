<H2><I>Using Transana With PowerPoint<HR ></I></H2><P>
A number of people have asked if Transana Clips can be embedded in PowerPoint presentations the way raw video can be.  The answer is that they cannot, primarily because Transana does not edit the raw video, but instead loads the full video and positions it according to the stored Clip data.  Instead, we recommend running Transana and PowerPoint simultaneously, with Transana in Presentation Mode and all the Clips stored in a custom Collection.  You can use the Alt-Tab key combination on Windows to switch between your presentation and the display of your Clips within Transana.  While it takes a little bit of practice to get used to this, the end result can be quite satisfactory, and is usually much easier than custom-editing video for a presentation.<P>
