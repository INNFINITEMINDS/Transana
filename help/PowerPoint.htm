<H2><I>Using Transana With PowerPoint</I><HR></H2>

If you are using Transana Professional, Multi-user Transana, or Transana for Computer Labs, you can use Transana's <B>Export Clip Video</B> function to export Clips, which you can then embed in PowerPoint presentations.  This function will use Transana's <A HREF="mediaconvert.htm">Media Conversion tool</A> to create a free-standing video file of the Clip's media contents.  This file can be linked from PowerPoint, although you should be careful to keep the media file(s) with the presentation file so PowerPoint can find them when needed.<P>  

A second option is to run Transana and PowerPoint simultaneously, with Transana in Presentation Mode and all the Clips for the presentation copied to a custom Collection.  You can use the Alt-Tab key combination on Windows or Command-Tab on the Mac to switch between your presentation and the display of your Clips within Transana.  While it takes a little bit of practice to get used to this, the end result can be quite satisfactory.<P>
