<H2><I>Adding a Keyword to an Existing Quote or Clip</I><HR></H2>

If you are using the Standard version of Transana, you can ignore the mention of Quotes in the following discussion.  The procedures for coding Quotes and Clips are identical, so they have been combined in this Tutorial page.<P>

Because of the way understanding evolves during qualitative analysis, it is quite likely that you will want to add new Keywords to existing Quotes and Clips during your analysis.  When we created our first Quotes and Clips earlier in this Tutorial, we didn't assign all the codes we might want to.  Let's fix that now.  Because coding is such a central analytic activity, Transana provides several ways to do this.<P>

First, let's create two new keywords in the <B>Tutorial</B> Keywords Group.  We have created Standard Quotes and Clips, and will shortly be moving on to Quick Quotes and Clips, so let's create Keywords for those concepts.<P>

Add the Keywords <B>Standard Creation Method</B> and <B>Quick Creation Method</B> to the <B>Tutorial</B> group.  (See <A HREF="creatingkeywords.htm">Creating Keywords</A> if you cannot remember how to create new keywords.)<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to add a keyword to an existing Quote or Clip.<P>

1. Make sure the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group node in the database tree is fully expanded. (If necessary, click the <B>+</B> or triangle next to <B>Keywords, </B>then the <B>+</B> or triangle next to <B>Tutorial</B>.)<P>

2. If you followed the Tutorial carefully, Quote <B>Create Quote by double-clicking Collection</B> doesn't have the <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword, and Clip <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> doesn't have the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> Keyword.  We didn't create those Keywords until after the first data items were created.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:  </FONT>Drag the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> up and drop it on the Quote <B>Create Quote by double-clicking Collection</B> under the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection in the database tree. <P>

Transana displays a dialog box asking you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:  </FONT>Right-click the keyword <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> and select <B>Copy</B> from the popup menu.  Then right-click the Clip <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> in the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection in the Database Tree.  Select the <B>Paste</B> option from the resulting menu.<P>

Transana displays a dialog box asking you to confirm that you want to add the keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.<P>

You can add a Keyword to all the items in a Collection by pasting or dropping the Keyword on the Collection.  Drag or copy the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Standard Creation Method</B> onto the Collection <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> to ensure that all of the Quotes and Clips in that Collection include that keyword.  Note that items that already have the Keyword will not be changed because of this duplication.<P>

You can also add Keywords to Documents, to Episodes, and to all items in a Library using copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop within the Database tab of the Data Window.  You can also copy multiple Keywords to paste as a group, or can select multiple items in a Collection for the paste action.<P>

Sometimes you might want to view a Quote or Clip while deciding what Keywords are appropriate.  Use this method to add a new Keyword, <B>Tutorial : Creation</B>, to any of your Quotes or Clips. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1.  Create a Keyword in the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group called <B>Creation</B>.<P>

2. Load a Quote or Clip by double-clicking it in the Collection <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> in the Database Tree. <P>

3. Check in the Options menu to make sure that <B>Quick Quote and Clip Mode</B> is not checked.  Drag the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Creation</B> and drop it on the Document window. Transana asks you to confirm that you want to add the Keyword. Click <B>Yes</B>.  (If <B>Quick Quote and Clip Mode</B> is checked, this action will create a Quick Quote or Quick Clip rather than applying the keyword to the data item currently loaded in Transana's main interface.)<P>

Also notice the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. This tab displays a list of Keywords associated with the Document, Episode, Quote, or Clips that is loaded in the Transana main interface. This tab allows you to edit or delete associated Keywords.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1. Click the <B>Keywords</B> tab in the Data window. Transana shows the keywords associated with your loaded Quote or Clip. <P>

2. Right-click anywhere on this tab and choose <B>Edit</B> from the pop-up menu. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/keywordstab.gif"  ALT="keywordstab"   BORDER=0><P>

Transana opens the <B>Edit Keyword List</B> dialog box, which looks like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/editkeywords.gif"  ALT="editkeywords"   BORDER=0><P>

3. If the <B>Keyword Group : Keyword</B> pair <B>Tutorial : Standard Creation Method</B> is not already listed in the Keywords box, select the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group, then double-click the <B>Standard Creation Method</B> keyword to add it to the data item.  Click <B>OK</B> if you added the Keyword, <B>Cancel</B> if you did not.<P>

Transana also allows you to add or delete keywords in the Properties dialog box that is associated with each Document, Episode, Quote, Clip, or Snapshot.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Use the database tree in the Data window. Follow these directions to add a keyword to the <B>Demo</B> episode: <P>

1. Right-click the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode in the <B>Demonstration Data</B> Library and choose <B>Episode Properties</B> from the pop-up menu. <P>

2. In the dialog box that appears, click on <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group in the field labeled <B>Keyword Group</B>. Then double-click <B>Creation</B> in the field labeled <B>Keyword</B> to add it to the Episode.  You should see the Keyword Group : Keyword pair appear in the <B>Episode Keywords</B> box to signal that the Keyword has been added to the Episode.  Click <B>OK</B> when you are done.<P>

3.  When you add Keywords to Documents and Episodes, you are defining default Keywords for the data item.  Threfore, Transana asks if you want to add those Keywords to all of the Quotes or Clips already created from that item.  Thus, you can use this method to add a new Keyword to all Quotes or Clips taken from a source Document or Episode, regardless of what Collections those data items reside in.  Click <B>No</B> because the <B>Tutorial : Creation</B> Keyword would not necessarily be approriate for all Clips created from this Episode.

4.  In fact, <B>Creation</B> isn't really a useful Keyword at all.  Right-click it in the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group in the Database Tree and select <B>Delete Keyword</B> from the menu.  Click <B>Yes</B> on the confirmation dialog.  This will remove this Keyword from the database, removing it from all Documents, Episodes, Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots it has been applied to.      

If this were a real analysis, you would want to edit your analytic memos as you were going along making these coding changes.  In each appropriate Note, you would add a date/time stamp and an explanation of the coding changes performed for each data object within Transana.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Because this is a practice analysis, let's just update one Note.<P>

1.  Locate the analytic memo note that you created earlier for the <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> Clip.  Double-click this note to open it for editing.<P>

2.  Decide if you want to add new comments to the top of the note or to the bottom and place your cursor at the appropriate location.  Press Ctrl-T to add a date/time stamp, and document your decision to add the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B>,  and <B>Tutorial : Standard Creation Method</B> Keywords to this Clip.  It is a good idea to leave a blank line between process notes from different days in your analytic memos.  Exit the note when you are done making your changes.<P>
