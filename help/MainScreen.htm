The <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A> is where you add, organize, and manipulate data objects in Transana.  The data window is where you select which documents, media files, and still images you want to work with in other windows, and the data window is where you initiate many analytic tasks in Transana.<P>

The <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">document window</A> is where you display and edit text documents and transcripts of media files.  <P>

The <A HREF="mediawindow.htm">media window</A> is where you control playback and positioning of audio and video files and where video is displayed.  When working with audio files, this window displays only the playback controller bar.<P>

The <A HREF="visualizationwindow.htm">visualization window</A> displays visual representations of the data loaded in the Transana interface in the form of a waveform diagram representing the audio track of media data or of a bar chart showing coding that has been applied to text and media files during the analytic process.<P>

The <A HREF="snapshotwindow.htm">snapshot window</A> displays still images and provides tools for manipulating and coding these images during the analytic process.<P>
