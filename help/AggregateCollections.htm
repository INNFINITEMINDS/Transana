<H2><I>Creating New Collections from Existing Clips<HR ></I></H2><P>
You can create collections manually from existing clips. You can move clips from one collection to another by selecting a clip and using cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop on Windows) to move it to the new location. (<FONT COLOR="Red">On Windows</FONT>, hold down the Ctrl key when you drop the clip to copy it instead of moving it; <FONT COLOR="Red">on Windows or Mac</FONT>, use Copy to copy instead of Cut to move the clip.) <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create a new collection and populate it with existing clips.<P>
1. In the Data window, right-click the <B>Collections </B>node, and select <B>Add Collection</B> from the pop-up menu. <P>
2. Type <B>Kids' Ideas About Symmetry</B> in the field labeled <B>Collection ID</B>. <P>
3. Enter your name or initials in the <B>Owner</B> field, and select the <B>Demonstration Keywords</B> from the <B>Default Keyword Group</B> list.  Click <B>OK </B>when you are done.<P>
4. Click on the clip called <B>Houses</B> from the <B>Symmetry</B> collection. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Windows-only Alternative:  </FONT>Hold down the <B>Ctrl</B> key, then drag it to the new collection called <B>Kids' Ideas About Symmetry</B>.  Be sure to continue holding down the Ctrl key when you release the mouse button.  <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh or Windows Alternative:  </FONT>Right-click <B>Houses</B> and select &quot;Copy&quot; from the popup menu.  Then right-click <B>Kids' Ideas About Symmetry</B> and select &quot;Paste&quot; from the popup menu.<P>
Transana opens a dialog box that asks you if you want to copy the clip. Click <B>Yes</B>.  If it asks if you want to move the clip, say <B>No</B> and try again.<P>
5. Use this same procedure to copy the clips called <B>The Same,</B> and <B>Folding</B> to the <B>Kids' Ideas About Symmetry</B> collection.<P>
Note that you can also move clips instead of copying them. To move a clip, use &quot;Cut&quot; instead of &quot;Copy&quot;, or on Windows only, don't hold the Ctrl key when you drop the clip. <P>
You can copy or move all the clips in a collection, by using cut/copy and paste (or on Windows using Drag and Drop) with a collection name within the database tree.  <P>
