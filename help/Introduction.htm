<B>Transana</B> is designed to facilitate the transcription and qualitative analysis of video and audio data.  It provides a way to view video, create a transcript, and link places in the transcript to frames in the video.  It provides tools for identifying and organizing analytically interesting portions of videos, as well as for coding those video clips.  It provides a variety of reports and graphs for examining coded video, as well as a mechanism for searching for portions of analytically interesting video by keyword and by combinations of keywords.  It also features database and file manipulation tools that facilitate the organization and storage of large collections of digitized video.<P>

More specifically, it allows users to:<P>

<UL><LI>Import and view video in MPEG-1, MPEG-2, AVI, MOV, and MP4 formats on Windows and Mac OS X, and WMV format on Windows only.  Transana also works with MP3 and Wave audio on Windows and OS X and WMA audio on Windows only.<P>

<LI>Easily create transcripts of the media files, either audio or video.  Special symbols for Jeffersonian Transcription are readily accessible, but are not required.<P>

<LI>Navigate through media files using several different mechanisms including a precise Waveform image.<P>

<LI>Link points in a media file to positions in a transcript by embedding time codes in the transcript.<P>

<LI>Automatically highlight the relevant portion of the transcript while the media file plays.<P>

<LI>Locate the portion of a media file that corresponds with a selected section of the transcript.<p>

<LI>Select analytically interesting portions of media files, which can be organized into meaningful groups.<P>

<LI>Define keywords and apply them to portions of media files.<P>

<LI>Create text reports about clips and coding, as well as graphs of coding across one or more media files.<P>

<LI>Search for instances of keywords or combinations of keywords and see or hear the media clips to which they have been applied.<P>

<LI>Generate a variety of reports about the analysis performed on media files.<P>

<LI>Create multiple transcripts which can be displayed simultaneously to facilitate the exploration of media files using multi-layered, multi-modal approaches.<P>

<LI>Connect multiple media files together for simultaneous playback and analysis.<P>

<LI>Collaborate with other researchers, near and distant, by allowing simultaneous access of analytic data by multiple researchers with real-time data updating.  (Multi-user version only.)<P>

<LI>Securely transfer media files to and from a Storage Resource Broker (SRB), a computer system with massive storage capacity, for collaboration purposes.</UL><P>

These activities allow researchers to do qualitative research using a wide variety of methodologies and theoretical approaches.<P>

Transana was originally created by Chris Fassnacht.  It is now developed and maintained by David K. Woods at the Wisconsin  Center for Education Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison.<P>
