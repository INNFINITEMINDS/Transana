<B>Transana</B> is designed to facilitate the qualitative analysis of video, audio, and still image data.  Transana allows researchers to: <P>

<UL><LI>view video, listen to audio, and view images<P>

<LI>navigate through large data sets easily<P>

<LI>create analytic transcripts of media files, and link the transcript to file contents<P>

<LI>identifying and organizing analytically interesting portions of media and image files<P>

<LI>code video, audio, and still images analytically<P>

<LI>view a variety of reports and graphs for exploring and interpreting coded media and image data<P>

<LI>search video, audio, and image by keyword and by combinations of keywords<P>

<LI>create multiple transcripts which can be displayed simultaneously to facilitate the exploration of media files using multi-layered, multi-modal approaches<P>

<LI>connect multiple media files together for simultaneous playback and analysis<P>

<LI>collaborate with other researchers, near and distant, by allowing simultaneous access of analytic data by multiple researchers with real-time data updating  (Multi-user version only)<P>

<LI>manage the organization and storage of large collections of digitized video, audio, and image files<P></UL>

These activities allow researchers to do qualitative research using a wide variety of methodologies and theoretical approaches.<P>

Transana was originally created by Chris Fassnacht.  It is now developed and maintained by David K. Woods at the Wisconsin  Center for Education Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison.<P>
