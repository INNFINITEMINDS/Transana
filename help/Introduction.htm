<B>Transana</B> is designed to facilitate the qualitative analysis of data, including text, video, audio, and still image data.<P>

Transana allows researchers to: <P>

<UL>
<LI>bring text, media (video and audio), and still image data into the analytic environment<P>

<LI>create analytic transcripts of media files, and link the transcripts to the media file contents<P>

<LI>identifying, manipulate, organizing, and code analytically interesting portions of text, media files, and image files<P>

<LI>create a variety of reports and graphs for exploring and interpreting coded text, media, and image data<P>

<LI>search coded data by keyword and by combinations of keywords<P>

<LI>organize large data sets easily<P>

<LI>collaborate with other researchers, near and distant, by allowing simultaneous access to analytic data by multiple researchers with real-time data updating  (Multi-user version only)<P>
</UL>

Transana pays special attention to the analytic needs of researchers with media data, offering several unique, powerful tools for working with audio and video files.  It allows researcher with media data to:<P>

<UL>
<LI>connect multiple overlapping media files together for simultaneous playback and analysis<P>

<LI>create multiple transcripts for media files which can be displayed simultaneously to facilitate the exploration of media files using multi-layered, multi-modal approaches<P>
</UL> 

These activities allow researchers to do qualitative analysis using a wide variety of methodologies and theoretical approaches.<P>

Transana is developed and maintained by David K. Woods, Ph.D. at the Wisconsin  Center for Education Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison.<P>
