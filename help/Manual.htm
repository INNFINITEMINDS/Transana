Welcome to Transana.  This manual provides an overview of Transana and most of its features.  It is made up primarily of Transana's context-sensitive help pages, which are accessed through the "Help" buttons on most of Transana's forms and dialog boxes.  The Transana manual isn't designed to be read like a book.<P>

If you want to learn how to use Transana, you should start with the <A HREF="tutorial.htm">Transana Tutorial</A>, which <B>is</B> designed to be read like a book.  The Tutorial directs you through the major steps used in analyzing data using Transana.  We recommend doing the exercises in the tutorial as you read the Tutorial, as we believe that greatly increases how well you will understand and retain the information you read.   When you are done with that, you may want to take a look at some additional topics in the manual, which address a number of more advanced topics.<P>

In addition, the Transana Web site (http://www.transana.org) is an excellent resource.  The Support section includes a number of "ScreenCast" videos, which demonstrate many of the common analytic tasks you will read about in the Tutorial, along with a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section, additional program documentation, and a Contact form so that Transana users can get help with questions about the use of the program.<P>
