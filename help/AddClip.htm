<H1>Clip Properties<HR ></H1><P>
To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Clip</A> in Transana, you first highlight the section of the Episode <A HREF="organization.htm">transcript</A> you wish to turn into a clip.  On Windows or Mac OS/X, you then press the &quot;Select Clip Text&quot; button <IMG SRC="images/selectcliptext.gif"  ALT="selectcliptext"   BORDER=0> in the Transcript Toolbar, then right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) on the Collection where you want to place the Clip and select &quot;Paste&quot; from the popup menu.  Alternately, on Windows only, you can drag the selected text from the Transcript onto a <A HREF="organization.htm">Collection</A> on the database tab of the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A>.  <P>
Note that you must have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript for Clip creation to work properly.  The video displayed as the Clip will be from the last time code preceding your highlight to the first time code following it.  Only what you highlight will be included in the Clip's Transcript.  Once you drop your selected text, you will see the Add Clip dialog box.<P>

The only required field is the &quot;Clip ID,&quot; which must be unique within the parent Collection.  &quot;Title/Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  By selecting a Keyword Group and Keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each Clip, enabling you to find this clip later when doing Keyword Searches.  The <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> button allows you to delete keywords from the list, and the <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> button allows you to access <A HREF="kwmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>.  The &quot;Collection ID,&quot; &quot;Series ID,&quot; &quot;Episode ID,&quot; &quot;Media Filename,&quot; &quot;Clip Start,&quot; &quot;Clip Stop,&quot; and &quot;Clip Length&quot; fields are all maintained by Transana and cannot be edited.  While you can edit the Clip Text if you like, it is not recommended.  Changes made here are not reflected in the original Episode transcript.<P>
One final note:  Unlike other branches of the Database Tree, Clips within a Collection have an &quot;order&quot; that can be altered by the user.  (This is important for &quot;Play All Clips&quot; and in the Collection Summary Report, both of which are useful for case development.)  If you paste or drop Transcript text on a Collection name, your new clip will be added to the end of the list of Clips within the Collection.  However, if you paste or drop your Transcript text on a Clip, the new Clip will be inserted in the list above the Clip where the test is pasted or dropped.  Finally, the order of Clips within a Collection can be altered using cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop in Windows) within the Collection.<P>
