<H1>Clip Properties</H1><HR>

To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Clip</A> in Transana, you first highlight the section of the episode <A HREF="organization.htm">transcript</A> you wish to turn into a clip.  You then drag the selected text from the transcript onto a <A HREF="organization.htm">collection</A> on the database tab of the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A>.  Alternately, once you have made your transcript selection, you can right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) on the collection where you want to place the clip and select &quot;Add Clip&quot; from the popup menu.  A third option is to make your transcript selection and then double-click the target collection.  Doing this will add the clip to the end of the list in the collection.  <P>

If you want to place the new clip in a particular place in the list of clips and snapshots in a collection, you can right-click an item in the list and choose &quot;Add Clip,&quot; or drop the transcript text on a specific item in the list.  If you do this, the new clip will be added above the selected item in the collection list.<P>

Note that you must have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript for clip creation to work properly.  The video displayed as the clip will start at the last time code preceding your highlighted transcript selection and end at the first time code following it.  Only what you highlight will be included in the clip's transcript.  <P>

If you add a clip using any of the three techniques described above without first making a selection in the transcript, Transana will automatically use the text between the time codes that immediately precede and follow the current transcript cursor position.<P>

You will then see the Add Clip dialog box.<P>

The only required field is the &quot;Clip ID,&quot; which must be unique within the parent collection.  &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  By selecting a keyword group and keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each clip, enabling you to find this clip later when doing keyword searches.  The <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button allows you to delete keywords from the list, and the <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button allows you to access <A HREF="kwmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>.  The &quot;Collection ID,&quot; &quot;Series ID,&quot; &quot;Episode ID,&quot; &quot;Clip Start,&quot; &quot;Clip Stop,&quot; and &quot;Clip Length&quot; fields are all maintained by Transana and cannot be edited.  While you can edit the clip text if you like, it is not recommended.  Changes made here are not reflected in the original episode transcript.<P>

When you edit a Clip using Clip Properties from the Clip's right-click menu, the <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif"> &nbsp;button will be visible.  This button is used to locate copies that match the original Clip ID, source transcript number, clip start time, and clip end time, and to update those copies so that they are identical to the current clip.  See <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">Clip Change Propagation</A> for more information.<P>

One final note:  Unlike other branches of the database tree, items within a collection have an &quot;order&quot; that can be altered by the user.  (This is important for &quot;Play All Clips&quot; and in the Collection Report.)  If you choose &quot;Add Clip&quot; or drop your transcript text on a collection name, your new clip will be added to the end of the list of clips and snapshots within the collection.  However, if you choose &quot;Add Clip&quot; or drop your transcript text on a clip or snapshot, the new clip will be inserted in the list above the item where the text is dropped.  Finally, the order of clips and snapshots within a collection can be altered using cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop within the collection.<P>
