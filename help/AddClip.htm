<H1>Clip Properties<HR ></H1><P>
To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Clip</A> in Transana, you first highlight the section of the episode <A HREF="organization.htm">transcript</A> you wish to turn into a clip.  On Windows or Mac OS/X, you then right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) on the collection where you want to place the clip and select &quot;Add Clip&quot; from the popup menu.  Alternately, on Windows only, you can drag the selected text from the transcript onto a <A HREF="organization.htm">collection</A> on the database tab of the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A>.  Doing this will add the clip to the end of the list in the collection.  If you want to place the new clip in a particular place in the list of clips in a collection, you can right-click a clip and choose &quot;Add Clip&quot;, or drop the transcript text on a specific clip in the list.  If you do this, the new clip will be added above the selected clip.<P>
Note that you must have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript for clip creation to work properly.  The video displayed as the clip will be from the last time code preceding your highlight to the first time code following it.  Only what you highlight will be included in the clip's transcript.  Once you drop your selected text, you will see the Add Clip dialog box.<P>

The only required field is the &quot;Clip ID,&quot; which must be unique within the parent collection.  &quot;Title/Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  By selecting a keyword group and keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each clip, enabling you to find this clip later when doing keyword searches.  The <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> button allows you to delete keywords from the list, and the <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> button allows you to access <A HREF="kwmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>.  The &quot;Collection ID,&quot; &quot;Series ID,&quot; &quot;Episode ID,&quot; &quot;Clip Start,&quot; &quot;Clip Stop,&quot; and &quot;Clip Length&quot; fields are all maintained by Transana and cannot be edited.  While you can edit the clip text if you like, it is not recommended.  Changes made here are not reflected in the original episode transcript.<P>
The <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif"> button is used to find copies of the clip you loaded into Clip Properties, locate copies that match the original Clip ID, source transcript, clip start time, and clip end time, and make those copies identical to the current clip.  See <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">Clip Change Propagation</A> for more information.<P>
One final note:  Unlike other branches of the database tree, clips within a collection have an &quot;order&quot; that can be altered by the user.  (This is important for &quot;Play All Clips&quot; and in the Collection Summary Report, both of which are useful for case development.)  If you choose &quot;Add Clip&quot; or drop transcript text on a collection name, your new clip will be added to the end of the list of clips within the collection.  However, if you choose &quot;Add Clip&quot; or drop your transcript text on a clip, the new clip will be inserted in the list above the clip where the text is dropped.  Finally, the order of clips within a collection can be altered using cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop in Windows) within the collection.<P>
