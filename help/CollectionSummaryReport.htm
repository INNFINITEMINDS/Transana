The Collection Summary Report lists all Clips in a Collection, providing information about clip name, video file name, clip start, clip stop, and clip length.  It also displays the transcript associated with each clip.  <P>
This information is useful in a variety of ways.  First off, it provides a rough &quot;script&quot; for a collection of clips, particularly when these clips are displayed using the Collection's &quot;Play All Clips&quot; option.  Second, this report provides the information necessary for video editing.  Thus, to use Transana for Case Development, all you need to do is build a Collection of the clips you want, placing them in the order you want to see them, and then use the information contained in the Collection Summary Report as the basis for your video editing.<P>
