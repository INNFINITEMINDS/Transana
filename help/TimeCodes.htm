<H1>Time Codes</H1><HR>

Time codes are <IMG SRC="images/timecode.gif"> marks that you can put into the text of your <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcripts</A> that link the media file and the transcript.  They are very useful for synchronizing a transcript with the media file and are essential for defining the start and end points for analytically interesting <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clips</A> within a larger media file.<P>

You can select a position in a a time-coded transcript, then right-click the Transcript to play the matching section in the associated media file.  If you play the media file, Transana will highlight the appropriate section of a time-coded Transcript as you go along (as long as you are not in Edit Mode.)  Time codes are essentail to both of these processes.<P>

To insert a time code, take the following steps:<P>

1. Make sure Transana is in edit mode (by pressing the <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif">&nbsp; button if necessary).  In edit mode, clicking in the Transcript to position the cursor doesn't move the media file position as it does when the Transcript is in read-only mode.<P>

2. With the program focus in the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document window</A>, use keyboard commands [Ctrl/Cmd-S (play/pause with auto-rewind), Ctrl/Cmd-D (play/pause with no auto-rewind), Ctrl/Cmd-A (rewind 10 seconds), and Ctrl/Cmd-F (fast-forward 10 seconds)] to position the media file at exactly the spot you want.  For example, you may want a time code where the speaker changes, so you would pause in the moment right after the first speaker has finished talking and right before the second speaker begins to speak.<P>

3. Position the Transcript cursor in the correct spot in the Transcript with a left-click. The location in the Transcript should match the position where you paused in the media file.  For example, you would place the Transcript cursor after the sentence you just heard from the first speaker in your media file and before the sentence you are about to hear from the second speaker by clicking at the start of the second speaker's statement in the Transcript.<P>

4. Either press Ctrl-T on Windows / Cmd-T on OS X in the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document window</A> or click the &quot;Current&quot; button in the <A HREF="visualizationwindow.htm">Visualization window</A> to insert the time code for the current media file position in the currently selected position in the Transcript.<P>

For more information about inserting time codes, see <A HREF="addingtimecodes.htm">Adding Time Codes</A> and <A HREF="advancedtimecodes.htm">Advanced Time Codes</A> in the <A HREF="tutorial.htm">Transana Tutorial</A>.  This process is also demonstrated in the ScreenCasts on the Transana Web Site.<P>
