<H1>Time Codes</H1><HR>

Time codes are marks that you can put into the text of your transcripts that link the media file and the transcript.  They are very useful for synchronizing a transcript with the media file and are essential for defining the start and end points for analytically interesting clips within a larger media file.<P>

You can right click on a portion of the transcript to play that section in the media file.  If you play the media file from the Video window or Visualization Window, Transana will highlight the appropriate section of the transcript as you go along, (as long as you are not in Edit Mode.)<P>

Not surprisingly, to insert a time code, you first need to specify a position in the video and a position in the transcript.  The easiest way to do this is to pause the video at the spot you want, or select the precise spot you want in the visualization window, and then click on the appropriate spot in the transcript to position the editing cursor.  When the correct video position is displayed in the visualization window and the transcript cursor is in the correct position in a Transcript that is in Edit Mode, a time code can be inserted by pressing the &quot;Current&quot; button in the visualization window or by pressing Ctrl-T while in the Transcript Window.<P>
