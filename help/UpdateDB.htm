<H1>Update DB<HR ></H1><P>
When you highlight one or more media file names on your local file system and press Update DB, the File Management Utility will search the <A HREF="transana.htm">Transana</A> database for references to the selected media files and will update the location of all references it finds.  This is extremely useful when you move media files from one location to another on your network.<P>
Update DB is only active for files on the local system.  You cannot point <A HREF="transana.htm">Transana</A> to a file on the <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A>.<P>
