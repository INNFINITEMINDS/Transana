<H1>Organizational Structure<HR ></H1><P>
Because the organizational structure is so central to how Transana works, we will take a moment to describe it at length.
<UL><LI>A <B>Series</B> is a group of related video files, and is denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/seriesicon.gif"  ALT="seriesicon"   BORDER=0> icon. For example, if you video multiple classrooms on multiple days, you might create a series named after the teacher or the subject matter.  <P>
<LI>Within a Series are records for one or more video files, which are called <B>Episodes</B>, denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/episodeicon.gif"  ALT="episodeicon"   BORDER=0> icon.  Each video file you have must have a separate Episode definition.<P>
<LI>Each Episode can contain one or more <B>Transcripts</B>, indicated using the <IMG SRC="images/transcripticon.gif"  ALT="transcripticon"   BORDER=0> icon.  You might choose to store your field notes as one transcript, to have a verbatim transcription as a second transcript, and to have a Jeffersonian-annotated transcription including information about phoneme pronunciation, non-word utterances, pauses, and gestures as a third transcript, each for its own unique analysis.<P>
<LI>A <B>Collection</B> is a group of conceptually-related video segments taken from your Episodes.  Collections are indicated with the <IMG SRC="images/collectionicon.gif"  ALT="collectionicon"   BORDER=0> icon, and are usually named for the common analytic theme you are trying to analyze by looking at the related video clips.<P>
<LI>Within a Collection are records for one or more analytically-interesting portions of Episodes, which are known as <B>Clips</B>, and which are given the <IMG SRC="images/clipicon.gif"  ALT="clipicon"   BORDER=0> icon.  The bulk of your analytic work is done at the Clip level.<P>
<LI>Collections can be nested (contained) within other Collections.  This allows more flexibility in specifying an analytic structure for your Clips.<P>
<LI>A <B>Keyword Group</B> is a group of related Keywords, and are denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/keywordgroupicon.gif"  ALT="keywordgroupicon"   BORDER=0> icon.  Keyword Group is stored as an integral part of the keyword because a given keyword can have multiple meanings.  For example, the keyword <I>Volume</I> means something quite different in the keyword group <I>Sound</I> than it does in the keyword group <I>Geometry</I>.<P>
<LI>Keyword Groups contain one or more <B>Keywords</B>, which have the <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"  ALT="keywordicon"   BORDER=0> icon.  Keywords can be assigned to Episodes and Clips to describe the analytically-interesting content of the associated video.  <P>
<LI>Keywords may contain Example Clips.  These clips should show clear examples of what is meant by the keyword.<P>
<LI><B>Search Results</B> are the data sets returned when <A HREF="search.htm">Keyword Searches</A> are performed, and are signified by the <IMG SRC="images/searchresulticon.gif"  ALT="searchresulticon"   BORDER=0> icon.  Search Results return Episodes within Series and Clips within Collections that match the search criteria you specify.  <P>
<LI><B>Notes</B>, as signified by the <IMG SRC="images/noteicon.gif"  ALT="noteicon"   BORDER=0> icon, are free-form text notes that can be applied to Series, Episodes, Transcripts, Collections, and Clips to allow for a more detailed description of what the name means or how it should be used.  More than one note may be created for each data object.  </UL><P>
If you have not completed the <A HREF="mainpage.htm">Transana Tutorial</A> yet, now would be a good time to do so.  The Tutorial contains instructions on how to perform many of the basic tasks required for using Transana, and we have chosen not to duplicate that information in the Manual.<P>
