<H1>Organizational Structure</H1><HR>

Transana is designed to be able to facilitate analysis of large data collections, and as a result implements an organizational scheme designed to help researchers manage very large corpora of complex data.  It is important to understand how Transana organizes information in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A>.  Transana will make more sense once you understand this basic organizational design.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/organization.gif"><P>

It is important to note that different types of data have different characteristics.  In Transana, we treat different types of data somewhat differently to allow analysis of each type of data to be logical and efficient.  While this can initially seem somewhat inconsistent, there are good reasons underlying the differences that you will see.<P>

<B><I>Original source text and media files</I></B> are stored under <B>Library</B> nodes in Transana's database tree.  The notion is that researchers will generally import long text and media files from which they will code smaller segments as analytic data.  Unlike text and media data, still image data is not brought into Library nodes.  (The relationship between the original data and a coded segment of that data is fundamentally different for images than for text or media data.)<P>

<UL><LI>A <A HREF="libraryproperties.htm">Library</A> is a group of related source files, and is denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/libraryicon.gif"  ALT="libraryicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon. All source files from a particular location, participant, subject, interviewer, or research project might be gathered in a Library and separated from source files from other locations, participants, subjects, interviewers, or research projects.  If you have data from a single small study, you will likely only have one Library, while large research projects can have dozens of different Libraries which help them organize and keep track of their data.  <P>

<UL>
<LI>Text files imported into Transana are called <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A>, and are denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/documenticon.gif"  ALT="documenticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Transana imports the text so that changes made to the original text file following import do not affect the copy within Transana.<P>
  
<LI>Media Files brought into Transana are called <A HREF="episodeproperties.htm">Episodes</A>, and are denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/episodeicon.gif"  ALT="episodeicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  (If you have overlapping media files <I>of the same events</I>, see <A HREF="multimedia.htm">Working with Multiple Media Files</A>.)  A link to the original media file is maintained in Transana, as video files themselves are too large to efficently store in the database.  Therefore, you should not rename your media files after bringing them into Transana, and if you need to move them, the <a href="filemanagement.htm">File Management</a> can help you update file references within the Transana database to the file location.<P>

<UL><LI>Each Episode can be associated with one or more <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcripts</A>, indicated using the <IMG SRC="images/transcripticon.gif"  ALT="transcripticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  You might choose to store your field notes as one transcript, to have a verbatim transcription as a second transcript, and to have a Jeffersonian-annotated transcription including information about phoneme pronunciation, non-word utterances, pauses, and gestures as a third transcript, each for its own unique analysis.  Some researchers use <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple simultaneous Transcripts</A> to encapulate information about different analytic layers they wish to explore independently or in conjuction.  Please note that while transcripts are extremely useful analytically and are highly recommended, it is possible to work in Transana without creating Transcripts.</UL></UL></UL><P>

From your corpus of raw text and media files, the Documents and Episodes with Transcript in your Libraries, you will identify smaller segments that are interesting to you for particular reasons.  These small bits are the <B><I>analytic data segments</I></B> that encapsulate the analytic meaning you find in your data files.  All analytic segments are stored under the <B>Collections</B> node in Transana's database tree.  Still images are also brought into Transana and coded at the Collection level.<P>

<UL><LI>A <A HREF="collectionproperties.htm">Collection</A> is a group of conceptually-related bits of analytic data, which can be short bits of text taken from your Documents, segments of media taken from your Episodes and Transcript, or still images related to your analysis.  Collections are indicated with the <IMG SRC="images/collectionicon.gif"  ALT="collectionicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, and are usually named for the common analytic theme you are building from your data.  (At least, that's how things are in the end.  At the beginning of the analytic process, you may well not know what is conceptually significant about your analytic data, so you may start with very vague collection names.  However, as your understanding of your data changes over time, one of the ways this emerging understanding is reflected is in changing collection names and shifting collection contents.  That is, of course, the nature of qualitative analysis.)<P>

<UL><LI>An important segment of text from a Document is known in Transana as a <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A>, and which are given the <IMG SRC="images/quoteicon.gif"  ALT="quoteicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Thematically similar Quotes from your various documents are gathered in Collections.<P>

<LI>Also within Collections are analytically-interesting portions of Episodes, which are known as <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clips</A>, and which are given the <IMG SRC="images/clipicon.gif"  ALT="clipicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.<P>

<LI>Similarly, <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshots</A> are still images used to further your analysis.  Snapshots, indicated by the <IMG SRC="images/snapshoticon.gif"  ALT="snapshoticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, may be whole, complex images.  Complex images can be coded through adding different shapes to the image to represent different analytic constructs.  Snapshots may also be small portions of larger images meant to isolate a particular aspect of the original image.  <P>

<LI>Collections can be nested (contained) within other Collections in a hierarchical structure.  This sort of sub-categorization allows considerable flexibility in specifying a meaningful analytic structure for your Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots.</UL></UL><P>

The bulk of your analytic work with your text, media, and image data in Transana is done through creating, manipulating, and coding Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots within Collections.  A Collection is one way of indicating the analytic meaning you have applied to a particular piece of your data.<P>

As mentioned above, the act of <B><I>coding</I></B> Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots is central analytic activities in Transana.  The coding structure you develop is stored under the <B>Keywords</B> node in Transana.  Keywords (that is, codes) are applied to Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots.<P>

<UL><LI>A <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keyword Group</A> is a group of related Keywords, and is denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/keywordgroupicon.gif"  ALT="keywordgroupicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Keyword Group is stored as an integral part of the keyword because a given keyword can have multiple meanings.  For example, the keyword <I>Volume</I> means something quite different in the <I>Audio</I> keyword group than it does in the <I>Geometry</I> keyword group.<P>

<LI>Keyword Groups contain one or more <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keywords</A>, which have the <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"  ALT="keywordicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Keywords can be assigned to Documents, Episodes, Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots to describe the analytically-interesting content of the associated data object.  <P>

<UL><LI>Keywords may contain Example Clips.  These clips should show clear examples of what is meant by the keyword.</UL></UL><P>

One way that you can analyze coded data files is through the exploration of relationships between codes using the Search tool.  The <B><i>results of searches</I></B> are displayed under the <B>Search</B> node in Transana's database tree.<P>

<UL><LI><A HREF="search.htm">Search Results</A> are the data sets returned when you perform <A HREF="search.htm">Keyword Searches</A>, and are signified by the <IMG SRC="images/searchresulticon.gif"  ALT="searchresulticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Search Results return Documents and Episodes within Libraries, as well as Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots within Collections that match the search criteria you specify.</UL><P>

<I><B>Additional information about the analytic process</I></B> can stored throughout Transana's database tree in the form of <B>Notes</B>.<P>

<UL><LI><A HREF="notes.htm">Notes</A>, as signified by the <IMG SRC="images/noteicon.gif"  ALT="noteicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, are free-form text notes that can be applied to Libraries, Documents, Episodes, Transcripts, Quotes, Collections, Clips, and Snapshots to allow for a more detailed description of what the item they are attached to means, how it should be used, and where it fits in the analysis.  You may create more than one note for each data object.  Many researchers use Notes to keep <B><i>analytic memos</I></B> within Transana.</UL><P>

<P>If you have not completed the <A HREF="tutorial.htm">Transana Tutorial</A> yet, now would be a good time to do so.  The Tutorial contains instructions on how to perform many of the basic tasks required for using Transana, and is in a linear form that is easier to follow than the Manual.  We have chosen not to duplicate information from the Tutorial in the Manual.</P>
