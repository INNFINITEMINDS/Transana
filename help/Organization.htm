<H1>Organizational Structure</H1><HR>

Transana is designed to be able to facilitate analysis of very large data collections, and as a result implements an organizational scheme designed to help researchers manage very large corpora.  This imposes some minor inconvenience on researchers with small data sets.  As a result, it is important to understand how Transana organizes information in the data window.  Transana will make more sense once you understand this basic organizational design.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/organization.gif"><P>

All <B><I>raw video</I></B> and audio data is stored under the <B>Series</B> node in Transana's database tree.  Transana uses a television metaphor here.<P>

<UL><LI>A <B>Series</B> is a group of related media files, and is denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/seriesicon.gif"  ALT="seriesicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon. All video files from a particular location, teacher, subject, curriculum, or research project might be gathered in a Series and separated from video files from other locations, teachers, subjects, curricula, or research projects.  If you have data from a single small study, you will likely only have one Series, while large research projects can have dozens of different Series which help them manage their data.  <P>

<LI>Within each Series are records for one or more data collection events, which are called <B>Episodes</B>, and are denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/episodeicon.gif"  ALT="episodeicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Each time you collect data, you must create a separate Episode definition.  If you have multiple media files <I>of the same events</I>, see <A HREF="multimedia.htm">Working with Multiple Media Files</A>.  Otherwise, you probably need to create separate Episodes for separate media files.<P>

<LI>Each Episode can contain one or more <B>Transcripts</B>, indicated using the <IMG SRC="images/transcripticon.gif"  ALT="transcripticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  You might choose to store your field notes as one transcript, to have a verbatim transcription as a second transcript, and to have a Jeffersonian-annotated transcription including information about phoneme pronunciation, non-word utterances, pauses, and gestures as a third transcript, each for its own unique analysis.  Some researchers use <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple simultaneous transcripts</A> to encapulate information about different analytic layers they wish to explore independently or in conjuction.</UL><P>

From your entire corpus of raw media files, you will identify smaller segments that are interesting to you for particular reasons.  These small bits are the <B><I>analytic segments</I></B> that encapsulate the analytic meaning you find in your media files.  All analytic media segments are stored under the <B>Collections</B> node in Transana's database tree.<P>

<UL><LI>A <B>Collection</B> is a group of conceptually-related video segments taken from your Episodes.  Collections are indicated with the <IMG SRC="images/collectionicon.gif"  ALT="collectionicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, and are usually named for the common analytic theme you are trying to analyze by looking at the related video clips.  (At least, that's how things are in the end.  At the beginning of the analytic process, you may well not know what is conceptually significant about your analytic data, so you may start with very vague collection names.  However, as your understanding of your data changes over time, one of the ways this emerging understanding is reflected is in changing collection names and shifting collection contents.  That is, of course, the nature of qualitative analysis.)<P>

<LI>Within a Collection are records for one or more analytically-interesting portions of Episodes, which are known as <B>Clips</B>, and which are given the <IMG SRC="images/clipicon.gif"  ALT="clipicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  The bulk of your analytic work in Transana is done at the Clip level through creating, manipulating, and coding clips.<P>

<LI>Collections can be nested (contained) within other Collections.  This allows considerable flexibility in specifying a meaningful analytic structure for your Clips.</UL><P>

As mentioned above, <B><I>coding</I></B> Clips is a central analytic activity in Transana.  The coding structure you develop is stored under the <B>Keywords</B> node in Transana.<P>

<UL><LI>A <B>Keyword Group</B> is a group of related Keywords, and is denoted with the <IMG SRC="images/keywordgroupicon.gif"  ALT="keywordgroupicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Keyword Group is stored as an integral part of the keyword because a given keyword can have multiple meanings.  For example, the keyword <I>Volume</I> means something quite different in the keyword group <I>Sound</I> than it does in the keyword group <I>Geometry</I>.  Keyword Groups in Transana are not stored in the database until they have Keywords in them.<P>

<LI>Keyword Groups contain one or more <B>Keywords</B>, which have the <IMG SRC="images/keywordicon.gif"  ALT="keywordicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Keywords can be assigned to Episodes and Clips to describe the analytically-interesting content of the associated video.  <P>

<LI>Keywords may contain Example Clips.  These clips should show clear examples of what is meant by the keyword.</UL><P>

One way that you can analyze coded media files is through the exploration of relationships between codes using the Search tool.  The <B><i>results of searches</I></B> are displayed under the <B>Search</B> node in Transana's database tree.<P>

<UL><LI><B>Search Results</B> are the data sets returned when you perform <A HREF="search.htm">Keyword Searches</A>, and are signified by the <IMG SRC="images/searchresulticon.gif"  ALT="searchresulticon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  Search Results return Episodes within Series and Clips within Collections that match the search criteria you specify.</UL><P>

<I><B>Information about the analytic process</I></B> is stored throughout Transana's database tree in the form of <B>Notes</B>.<P>

<UL><LI><B>Notes</B>, as signified by the <IMG SRC="images/noteicon.gif"  ALT="noteicon"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, are free-form text notes that can be applied to Series, Episodes, Transcripts, Collections, and Clips to allow for a more detailed description of what the item they are attached to means, how it should be used, and where it fits in the analysis.  You may create more than one note for each data object.  Many researchers use Notes to keep <B><i>analytic memos</I></B> within Transana.</UL><P>

<P>If you have not completed the <A HREF="mainpage.htm">Transana Tutorial</A> yet, now would be a good time to do so.  The Tutorial contains instructions on how to perform many of the basic tasks required for using Transana in a linear form, and we have chosen not to duplicate that information in the Manual.</P>
