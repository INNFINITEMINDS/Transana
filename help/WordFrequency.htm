<H1>Word Frequency Report</H1><HR>

<P>The <B>Word Frequency Report</B> allows you to explore the use of words and language in <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A>, <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Episode Transcripts</A>, <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quotes</A>, and <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip Transcripts</A> in your database.</P>  

<P>This report can cover a variety of different scopes of data.  To generate a Word Frequency Report, right-click the appropriate node in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">database tree</A> and choose <B>Word Frequency Report</B> from the pop-up menu.  Reports are available for the following data scopes:</P>

<P>Transana allows you to create <B>Word Groups</B> containing different forms of the same basic word or synonyms.  All words in the Word Group will be displayed together.  To create a Word Group, check all of the entries in the list on the Results tab and press the "Group Checked Items" button.  The first item clicked will be auto-selected as the Word Group name, although you can edit this if you wish.</P>

<P>The <B>Do Not Show Group</B> is a special Word Group that is not displayed at all in the Word Frequency Report.  To add items to the Do Not Show Group, check the desired entries and perss the "Do Not Show Checked Items" button.</P>

<P>If you want to change the name of a Word Group or remove some of the words in the group, highlight the desired word group and press the "Edit Word Group" button.  If you press this button without first highlighting a group, you can edit the Do Not Show Group.</P>

<P>You can also initiate <B>text searches</B> from within the Word Frequency Report.  Check one or more entries on the Results page.  Then press the "Text Search for Checked Items" button in the report toolbar.  If any of the checked items is for a Word Group, all words in the Word Group will be added to the text search terms.  After a few moments, you should see the results of your text search request show up in the Search node of the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data Window</A>.</P>

<P>The <B>Group Words by Pattern</B> tab allows you to add words to Word Groups that follow a pattern that you specify.  For example, in English, it is common for the plural of a word to be that word plus the letter "s".  To group singular and plural word together, you would type "s" into the "Word Ending" box on the Group Words by Pattern tab and press the "Apply Pattern" button.  </P>

<P>However, it is very important to check the results of a pattern grouping for <B>False Positives</B>.  For example, "as" is not the plural of "a" and "is" is not the plural of "I".  Similarly, "noted" is not the past tense of "not", and "used" is not the past tense of "us".  At least in English, it is imperative to carefully remove false positives following pattern grouping.</P>

<P>On the <B>Options</B> tab, you can specify options that affect how your Word Frequency results are presented.  These options include the minimum frequency and minimum word length required to be displayed in the results.</P>

<P>When you have finished looking at the report, click the Close button to exit.</P>
