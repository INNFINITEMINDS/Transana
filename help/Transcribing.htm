Transcription within Transana is a manual process.  Voice recognition technology is not sophisticated enough in most instances to produce useful text from the data researchers collect in most research settings. With a little practice you will find that Transana's transcription tools make the process faster and easier than many transcription options.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT><P>

1. In the Document window's toolbar, click the Edit Mode icon, which looks like this: <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>. When you do this, the Document window is put into edit mode and all the icons on the Document toolbar are enabled.<P>

2. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> on Windows or <B>Cmd-S</B> on OS X to start the video. Listen for a few seconds, then press Ctrl/Cmd-S again to pause the video. Type what you heard. <P>

3. Press <B>Ctrl/Cmd-S</B> again to restart the video. Transana automatically rewinds the video two seconds, as many transcribers find this overlap helpful during the transcription process.<P>

Continue to use Ctrl/Cmd-S to start and stop the video as necessary as you transcribe the audio. It is a commom practice to insert a blank line in the transcript each time the speaker changes, as you will find it much easier to work with your transcript if you add this visual demarcation of speaker change.  That is not, however, an issue in the Transana Tutorial video file.<P>

Note these other features you might find useful:<P>

	Ctrl/Cmd-A starts media file playback with a ten-second rewind. <P>

	Ctrl/Cmd-D pauses or starts media file playback with no rewind.<P>

	Ctrl/Cmd-F moves the media file forward by ten seconds and plays it.<P>

	Ctrl/Cmd-(comma) slows down media file playback by 10% of normal speed, if playback speed change is possible, which varies by media format and type of computer.<P>

	Ctrl/Cmd-(period) speeds up media file playback by 10% of normal speed, if playback speed change is possible.<P>
  
Transcribe until you feel comfortable with the process, making sure to transcribe at least the first three minutes of the Tutorial video file.<P>

4. Click the Save icon periodically.  When you have finished transcribing, leave Edit mode.<P>

Here is an example of a portion of a finished transcript.  Yours could look quite different:<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  Some researchers use multiple simultaneous transcripts to implement multiple analytic layers.  See <A HREF="multitrans.htm">Working with Multiple Transcripts</A> in the <A HREF="manual.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more information.<P>
