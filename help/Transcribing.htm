Transcription within Transana is a manual process.  Voice recognition technology is not sophisticated enough in most instances to produce anything useful from the data researchers collect in most research settings. With a little practice you will find that Transana's transcription tools make the process faster and easier than many transcription options.<P>

The teacher in the Demo.mpg video is discussing the manipulation of the <B>core squares </B>of a quilt with the students.  Their current activity is to observe what happens when she <B>flips</B> the core square, and later, she and the students will discuss <B>symmetry</B> in <B>two-by-two designs</B>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT>  Follow these directions:<P>

1. In Transcription window's toolbar, click the Edit Mode icon, which looks like this: <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>. When you do this, the Transcription window is put into edit mode and all the icons on the Transcription toolbar are enabled.<P>

2. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> to start the video. Listen for a few seconds, then press Ctrl-S again to pause the video. Type what you heard. <P>

3. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> again to restart the video. Transana automatically rewinds the video two seconds to give you time to get your bearings. This is a standard feature of transcription devices.<P>

Continue to use Ctrl-S to start and stop the video as necessary as you transcribe the audio. Insert a blank line in the transcript each time the speaker changes. You will find it much easier to work with your transcript if you add this visual demarcation of speaker change.<P>

Note these other features you might find useful:<P>

	Ctrl-A starts media file playback with a ten-second rewind. <P>

	Ctrl-D pauses or starts media file playback with no rewind.<P>

	Ctrl-F moves the media file forward by ten seconds and plays it.<P>

	Ctrl-(comma) slows down media file playback by 10% of normal speed, (if playback speed change is possible.)<P>

	Ctrl-(period) speeds up media file playback by 10% of normal speed, (if playback speed change is possible.)<P>

4. Click the Save icon periodically. Be sure to save when you have finished transcribing.<P>

Here is an example of a portion of a finished transcript.  Yours could look quite different:<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  Some researchers use multiple simultaneous transcripts to implement multiple analytic layers.  See <A HREF="multitrans.htm">Working with Multiple Transcripts</A> in the <A HREF="mainpage.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more information.<P>
