Transcription within Transana is a manual process.  Voice recognition technology is not sophisticated enough in most instances to produce anything useful from the video people collect for analysis. With a little practice you will find that transcription is easy, and Transana's transcription tools are not difficult to use.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> The teacher in this video is discussing the manipulation of the <B>core squares </B>of a quilt with the students.  Their current activity is to observe what happens when she <B>flip</B>s the core square, and later, she and the students will discuss <B>symmetry</B> in <B>two-by-two designs</B>.<P>
Follow these directions:<P>
1. In Transcription window, click the Edit Mode icon, which looks like this: <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>. When you do this, all the icons on the Transcription toolbar are enabled, and the Transcription window is in Edit mode.<P>
2. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> to start the video. Listen for a few second, then press Ctrl-S again to pause the video. Type what you hear. <P>
3. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> again to restart the video. Transana automatically rewinds the video two seconds to give you time to get your bearings. This is a standard feature of transcription devices.<P>
Continue to use Ctrl-S to start and stop the video as necessary as you transcribe the audio. Insert a blank line in the transcript each time the speaker changes. You will find it much easier to work with your transcript if you add this visual demarcation of speaker change.<P>
Note these other features you might find useful:<P>
	Ctrl-A starts the video with a ten-second rewind. <P>
	Ctrl-D starts with video with no rewind.<P>
	Ctrl-F moves the video forward by ten seconds.<P>
4. Click the Save icon periodically. Be sure to save when you have finished transcribing.<P>
<P>A portion of my finished transcript looks like this, though yours could look quite different:<BR><BR>
