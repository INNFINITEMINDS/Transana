Transana offers a wide variety of options for controlling video playback, especially once you have a time-coded transcript to work with. You can control the playback from the Video window, the Transcript window, and the Visualization window. Spend some time now trying out the different methods of starting and stopping the video. Begin with the Video window.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> The Video window works as you'd expect, if you've ever used video playback software such as Windows Media Player. Click the title bar of the Video window to make it the active window, then use the following controls:
<UL><LI>Click the start button to start the video. <P>
<LI>Click the pause button to pause the video. You can then restart it from the same place with the start button.<P>
<LI><FONT COLOR="Red">Microsoft Windows Activity:  </FONT>Click the stop button to stop the video and automatically rewind to the beginning of the video.  (The Mac Quicktime Player does not have a Stop button.)<P>
<LI>Use the slider bar to move around the video.</UL><P>
Note that the skip back, rewind, fast forward and skip forward buttons in Windows are disabled. <P>
Notice that as you move through the video, Transana highlights the segments of the transcription that correspond to your place in the video. Segments are defined as those parts of the video that fall between time codes, in this case, the words of each different speaker.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>You can also start and pause the video from the Visualization window. This is useful for certain kinds of analysis, and also allows you to position the video according to elapsed time. Click anywhere in the waveform, then right-click to start playing the video. Right-click again to pause it; right-click is a toggle. Therefore remember these two facts:
<UL><LI>Left click selects your location<P>
<LI>Right-click starts and pauses the video.</UL><P>
Notice when you move your mouse pointer over the waveform, Transana shows you the corresponding time on the Visualization window status bar, next to the label &quot;Time.&quot; (On the Mac, you may have to activate the Visualization window by clicking on it first.)  This is elapsed time, from the beginning of the video, to the point where the mouse pointer is located. As you move your crosshair cursor through the waveform, notice the time changes.  <P>
When you click on the Waveform to select a position in the video, the &quot;Current&quot; time indicator switches to the selected time.  Also notice that Transana highlights the segment of the transcription that corresponds to your place in the video, just as it does when you play a video from the Video window.<P>
You can also play just a selected portion of the video from the Visualization window. Click and drag your mouse over a portion of the waveform, then right-click.  If you are having difficulty understanding a portion of the video during transcription, it can be very helpful to highlight that portion in the Visualization window and right-click the waveform repeatedly to have that segment played over and over until you can decipher it.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these directions to play the video from the Transcript window. The Transcript window provides the easiest way to play individual time coded segments of your video.<P>
1. Click in the Transcript Window to make the Transcript window the active window. <P>
2. Left-click anywhere in the transcript to select a segment, then right-click anywhere on the transcript to start playing the video. Transana plays from the time code preceding the cursor in the Transcript window to the time code following the cursor.  <P>
3. You can also play from one segment of the video through to the end. Click anywhere in the transcript.  <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Microsoft Windows Activity: </FONT> Press Ctrl and right-click. <P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh Activity:  </FONT>hold down the &quot;Command,&quot; or &quot;Meta&quot; key along with the Ctrl key while clicking the transcript.  <P>
Transana plays from that point in the video to the end.<P>
4. If you want to play a larger segment that crosses time codes, click and drag to highlight the desired section of the transcript, then right-click to play the highlighted part.<P>
Notice something about the interaction of the three windows: When you select and play a portion of the transcript in the Transcription window, Transana uses the beginning of the selection as the starting point when you start the video from the Video window (by clicking Play). <P>
Notice also that as you move around the Visualization window, and click different parts of the waveform, the video in the video window and the highlight in the transcript move also. Transana uses the place where you clicked in the Visualization window as the starting point if you click the Play button in the Video window. <P>
