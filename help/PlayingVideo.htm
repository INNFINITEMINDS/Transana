Transana offers a number of options for controlling video playback, especially once you have a time-coded transcript to work with. You can control the playback from the Video window, the Visualization window, and the Transcript window. Spend some time now trying out the different methods of starting and stopping the video, beginning with the Video window.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>To play the media file from the Video window, press the green Play button in the lower left corner of the video window.  You will notice that when the media file is playing, the button changes from Play to Pause, and that when the media file is paused, the button changes from Pause to Play.  You will also note that there is a video position slider in the video window's control bar which indicates the video player's current position and allows you to change the current position of the media file.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>You can start, pause, and position the video from the Visualization window. This is useful for certain kinds of analysis, and also allows you to position the video according to elapsed time. If you are on a Macintosh, click once on the Visualization window to make it the active window.  (This is not necessary on Windows.)  Left-click anywhere in the waveform to set the media file position, then right-click to start playing the media file. Right-click again to pause it; right-click is a toggle. Remember these two facts:<P>

<UL><LI>Left click selects your location<P>

<LI>Right-click starts and pauses the video.</UL><P>

Notice that as your media file plays, Transana highlights the segments of the transcription that correspond to the current location of the media file. Segments are defined as those parts of the video that fall between time codes, in this case, the words of each different speaker.<P>

Notice when you move your mouse pointer over the waveform, Transana shows you the corresponding time on the Visualization window status bar, next to the label &quot;Time.&quot; (On the Mac, you may have to activate the Visualization window by clicking on it first.)  This is elapsed time from the beginning of the video to the point where the mouse pointer is located. As you move your crosshair cursor through the waveform, notice the time changes.  <P>

When you click on the Waveform to select a position in the video, the &quot;Current&quot; time indicator switches to the selected time.  Also notice that Transana highlights the segment of the transcription that corresponds to your place in the video.<P>

You can also play just a selected portion of the video from the Visualization window. Hold the left mouse button down in the visualization and drag your mouse over a portion of the waveform.  Release the left mouse button, then right-click in the visualization.  Just the highlighted selection plays.  If you are having difficulty understanding a portion of the video during transcription, it can be very helpful to highlight that portion in the Visualization window and right-click the waveform repeatedly to have that segment play over and over until you can decipher it.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these directions to play the video from the Transcript window. The Transcript window provides the easiest way to play individual time coded segments of your video.<P>

1. If you are on a Mac, left-click in the Transcript window to make the Transcript window the active window. (This is not necessary on Windows.)<P>

2. Left-click anywhere in the transcript to select a time-coded segment, then right-click anywhere on the transcript to start playing the video. Transana plays from the time code preceding the cursor in the Transcript window to the time code following the cursor.  <P>

3. If you want to play a larger segment that crosses time codes, click and drag to highlight the desired section of the transcript, then right-click to play the highlighted part.<P>

4. You can also play from one segment of the media file through to the end. Left-click anywhere in the transcript.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Microsoft Windows Activity: </FONT> Press Ctrl and right-click. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Macintosh Activity:  </FONT>hold down the &quot;Command,&quot; or &quot;Meta&quot; key along with the Ctrl key while clicking the transcript.  <P>

Transana plays from that point in the media file to the end, or until you stop playback with another right-click.<P>

5.  Now put the transcript in Edit Mode by pressing the <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>&nbsp; button.  Now play the video again using Ctrl-right-click on Windows or Command-right-click on the Mac.  Notice that you do not get word-tracking when the transcript is in Edit mode.  Right-click the transcript again to stop playback and take the transcript out of Edit mode.<P>

When you are reviewing your data, the linkage between the transcript and the media file can be very useful.  It's really nice to be able to read what is being said as the media file plays, to search for words in a transcript, and to be able move the media file to the spot that corresponds with something interesting you've found in a transcript.  But when you're transcribing a media file or editing a transcript, you don't want the transcript cursor, which controls your editing position, to move when you play the video.  You want your cursor to remain stationary so you can edit the transcript easily. In addition, left-click positioning in the transcript causes the media file position to change when you are not in edit mode, but not when you are in edit mode, where you probably don't want the media file to change every time you move your cursor.  (Right-clicking in the transcript does change the media position, whether you are in edit mode or not, but left-clicking in the transcript does not.)<P>
