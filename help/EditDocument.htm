<H2><I>Text - Edit a Document</I><HR></H2>

If you are using the <B>Student</B> version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Working with text data is only supported in the <B>Professional</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, and <B>Multi-User</B> versions of Transana.<P>

In many cases, it is not necessary (or would be inappropriate) to alter or edit text data you have imported into Transana.  However, there are times when such edits may be necessary or desirable.  Some users may even choose to create Documents within Transana to create project-wide analytic memos or to start their analytic write-up.<P>

Documents in Transana are loaded in a read-only mode by default, and should be left in read-only mode most of the time.  If you want to edit a Document, click the Edit Mode icon, which looks like this: <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>. When you do this, the Document window is put into edit mode and all appropriate icons on the Document toolbar are enabled.<P>

To save your changes, press the Edit Mode icon (<IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0>) again.  Transana will prompt you about saving your changes.<P>

In Transana, text is imported when you create a Document and is stored in the database.  If you edit the Document in Transana, this does not affect the original source file.  Similarly, if you edit the source file, this does not affect the Document in Transana.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Optional Activity:</FONT>  If you are interested in using Transana as a writing tool in addition to using it as an analytic tool, follow these instructions:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Create a new Library called "Research Journals".  This library should be used exclusively for Documents you create for the purpose of documenting your analytic process and writing up your process and analytic results.<P>

<LI>Create a new empty Document in your Research Journals Library.  Give the Document any name you feel adequately describes the contents you intend to record in that Document.  You can create multiple research journal documents to meet whatever analytic writing needs you have.<P>

<LI>Reseach Journal Documents are normal Documents in Transana.  That means you can create Quotes from them, code them, add Snapshots to them, attach Notes to them, export them as Rich Text Format files, and do anything else you can do with normal Documents.<P>

We won't refer to working with Research Journals much in the Tutorial, but be sure to look at <A HREF="WorkingWithJournals.htm">Working with Research Journals</A> later in the Tutorial.  The power of Research Journals is clearer once we are futher along in data analysis.<P>
