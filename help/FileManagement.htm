File Management, found in the Tools menu, is a tool to help you organize your media files.  It can display two file locations.  You can copy and move files between locations, and you can delete files on either location.  <P>

When you have moved a media file within your local File System (including your network, but not including a SRB Collection,) it is important to select that file in the new location and click the Update DB button. This will update the proper <A HREF="organization.htm">Episode</A> and <A HREF="organization.htm">Clip</A> records in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Database</A> with the new file location. Otherwise, Transana will be unable to locate your media files, and will be unable to play <A HREF="organization.htm">Episodes</A> and <A HREF="organization.htm">Clips</A> when requested.<P>

You may notice that the File Management Utility does not provide a way to rename media files.  To preserve data integrity related to millisecond accuracy of start and stop positions, we have not provided a way to change the media file associated with Clips, other than changing the PATH (but not the File Name) provided by the Update DB button.  We strongly recommend that you do NOT change file names of media files once you have begun working with them in Transana.  If you do, you will have to recreate your Clips.<P>

Transana's File Management tool also has the ability to connect with a Storage Resource Broker, or SRB.  A SRB is a computer system designed to store massive amounts of data.  Because data transfer between the local computer and the SRB is automatically encrypted, this is an excellent way to distribute media files securely and confidentially to team members who cannot access your local storage locations.<P>
