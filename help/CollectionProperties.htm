<H1>Collection Properties</H1><HR>

A <A HREF="organization.htm">Collection</A> in Transana is a place to group together bits of analytic data, the small segments you select from <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A> and <A HREF="episodeproperties.htm">Episodes</A>, as well as <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshots</A>, that you find analytically important or interesting.  One can think of a Collection like a pile of paper clippings from old-school manual methods, and it is also important to recognize that placing a <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quote</A>, <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clip</A>, or <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshot</A> in a Collection is one of the ways of coding data in Transana.<P>

To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Collection</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the &quot;Collections&quot; node in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Collection.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is a &quot;Collection ID&quot; that is unique in the parent object.  &quot;Owner&quot; can be used to indicate the person who created or is in some other way responsible for the Collection, and &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  The &quot;Default Keyword Group&quot; is the <A HREF="keywordproperties.htm">Keyword Group</A> that will be displayed by default when <A HREF="quoteproperties.htm">Quotes</A>, <A HREF="clipproperties.htm">Clips</A>, or <A HREF="snapshotproperties.htm">Snapshots</A> are added to this Collection.<P>

Collections can also be nested within other Collections.  This allows Transana to represent more complex analytical structures and relationships within the Data Tree Display.  Simply right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) an existing Collection and select the &quot;Add Nested Collection&quot; option.<P>
