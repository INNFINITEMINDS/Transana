Notes are free-form text which can be attached to <A HREF="organization.htm">Series</A>, <A HREF="organization.htm">Episodes</A>, <A HREF="organization.htm">Transcripts</A>, <A HREF="organization.htm">Collections</A>, or <A HREF="organization.htm">Clips</A>.  You can use notes to document a variety of different types of information about your data and analysis.  This process is often referred to as analytic memoing.  You can have multiple notes for each object.<P>

<LI>Series notes can document information about how a group of media files (episodes) are connected.  </LI>

<LI>Episode notes can document information about when, how, and under what circumstances the associated media files were collected.  Insights gleened from Episode-based reports can also be documented through episode notes.</LI>

<LI>Transcript notes can document the analytic functions of different transcripts when multiple transcripts are being used.  You might document who created the transcript, what changes have been made to the transcript over time, and why those changes were made.  Any analytic decision that is reflected in your transcript, such as decisions about what to transcribe (and what to skip,) what transcribing conventions were used and what exceptions were made to those conventions, and your thoughts about the analysis of what is shown in the transcript based on your interpretation of your transcript notation can all be reflected in transcript notes. </LI>

<LI>Collection notes can document the analytic meaning of a collection, to explain what you see that groups the clips gathered into the collection together.  Collection notes can be a way to keep track of the analytic decisions you make as your analysis progresses.  For example, if you decide it is appropriate to divide the clips in a collection into sub-categories, reflected in nested collections, it can be very helpful to document your reasoning in a collection note attached to the parent collection.</LI>

<LI>Clip notes can document analytic decisions you make during clip creation, including information about your reasoning for starting and ending clips at the particular points you chose, what you saw that made you select that clip, why you chose the particular keywords you chose, and how your thinking about what the clip and its coding means has changed over time.</LI>

<P>You can create a note by right-clicking a series, episode, transcript, collection, or clip and choosing "Add Note" from the menu.  Notes are saved automatically in Transana when you close them.  The <A HREF="NotesBrowser.htm">Notes Browser</A>, available in the Tools menu, is designed to allow you to look at the notes you have created, explore them, and generate reports of your notes.</P>

<P>It is often useful to include a date/time stamp in a note to reflect when you edited it or when you reached (or changed) a particular insight.  Therefore, there is a timestamp button in the Note Editor toolbar, or you can insert a timestamp by pressing Ctrl-T.  You can export notes to plain text files, print them, or search a note for a word or phrase.  (Searching across notes for a word or phrase is available in the <A HREF="NotesBrowser.htm">Notes Browser</A> but not from within the Note Editor.)</P>
