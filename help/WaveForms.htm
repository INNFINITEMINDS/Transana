If this is the first time the sample video has been loaded on your computer, you see the following prompt:  <P>

<IMG SRC="images/createwaveform.gif"  ALT="createwaveform"   BORDER=0><P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT>  Click <B>Yes</B>.  <P>

Transana extracts the audio track from your media file so that it can create a waveform diagram of the media file's audio track. A waveform diagram is a visual representation of the intensity of the video's sound.  The image below shows the Transana screen with the sample video in the Video window, and the waveform in the Visualization window.<P>

Because audio extraction sometimes takes a few minutes, Transana saves the extracted audio files in the waveforms directory, as defined in <A HREF="programoptionsmu.htm">Program Settings</A>.  If the media files are shared, it often works out well to also share a waveforms directory.<P>

It's now a good idea to do a bit more analytic memoing.  No action in Transana should be considered finished until you have written about it in an analytic memo.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT>  Right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the <B>Demo</B> episode and choose "Add Episode Note" from the popup menu.  Name the new note <B>Demo Episode</B> and enter your initials as NoteTaker.  Press <B>OK</B>.<P>

Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp in the note.  It's probably a good idea to record information about when and where your media file was collected and how it fits into the larger study.  Also include any other information about the episode that might be relevant to the analytic process.  When you are done recording your analytic process information, close the episode note.<P>

Now right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the <B>Transcript</B> transcript record for the <B>Demo</B> episode and choose "Add Transcript Note" from the popup menu.  Name your note <B>Transcript Note</B>, enter your intials as NoteTaker, and press <B>OK</B>.<P>

Again, start by pressing Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp in the note.  Now write your analytic memo about the transcript.  Here, you might record the type of transcription contained in this transcript, (we will be doing verbatim transcription for the demo,) as well as time-stamped insights that you have while doing the transcription and any other information that might be relevant to the transcript or transcription process.  Close the note when you are finished recording your analytic memo.<P>
