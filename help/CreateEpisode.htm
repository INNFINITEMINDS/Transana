Once you've created a Library, you can add your first Episode. <B>An Episode contains the media file(s) related to a single event in time.</B>  <P>

For the tutorial, we will use the sample video file that you downloaded from the Transana Web site.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT><P>

1. To add an Episode, right-click the <B>Demonstration Data</B> Library, then choose the <B>Add Episode </B> option from the menu.  <P>

Notice that the Library ID is already filled in, and that your Default Keyword Group and Keywords are shown.  <P>

2. Press the <B>Add File</B> button and select the "Transana with Media.mp4" video file you downloaded earlier.  Notice that if you leave Episode ID blank, Transana will automatically name your Episode after the first media file you select.  (You are free to change this name if you wish.)<P>

3. Double-click on the <B>Tutorial : Episode</B> Keyword to assign this Keyword to the Episode.  Adding this Keyword as an <i>Episode Keyword</I> will cause it to be included as a default Keyword for all Clips made from this Episode.  <P>

4. Click OK. Transana adds the Episode to the database tree and automatically displays the Add Transcript dialog box. <P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT> If you have a large number of media files to import into a single Library, you can use the <A HREF="batchitemcreation.htm">Batch Episode Creation</A> tool.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  The Professional, Computer Lab, and Multiuser versions of Transana are capable of supporting the analysis of multiple simultaneous media files.  Please see <A HREF="multimedia.htm">Working with Multiple Media Files</A> in the <A HREF="manual.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more information.  It is important to note that when you put multiple files in a single episode, those files should overlap rather than being consecutive.  Consecutive files need to be analyzed as separate episodes, or need to be combined into a single media file using video editing software prior to being brought into Transana.<P>
