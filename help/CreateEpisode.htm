Once you've created a series, you can add an episode. Use the sample video file that you downloaded from the Transana Web site.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these directions:<P>
1. To add an episode, right-click on <B>Sample </B>under the Series node, then choose <B>Add Episode </B> from the menu.  <P>

You see the following dialog box.<P>
<IMG SRC="images/addepisode.gif"  ALT="addepisode"   BORDER=0><P>
Notice that the Series ID is already filled in, and that your Default Keyword Group and Keywords are shown.  <P>
2. In the Episode ID field, enter <B>Sample Video</B> and click the Browse button to select the Demo.mpg video file in the C:\Program Files\Transana 2\Sample folder on Windows or the HOME/Movies/Sample folder on the Mac (or wherever you saved it.)  <P>
3. Double-click on the <B>Geometry</B> and <B>Quilt</B> keywords to assign these keywords to this Episode.  (This video is a lesson on teaching geometry through a quilting exercise, and adding those keywords to the episode will cause them to be used as the default keywords for all clips made from this episode.)  <P>
4. Click OK. Transana displays the Add Transcript dialog box. <P>
