<P>
As you work with your data in Transana, you may find that you end up with multiple copies of some clips.  You may copy clips because they fit into several places in your analytic structure, or you may create copies of clips as a result of converting search results to collections.  You may find that you want to make identical changes to all copies of a particular clip.  The &quot;Propagate Clip Changes&quot; function allows a researcher to synchronize copies of clips if desired.
<P>
(Please see <A HREF="propagateepisodechanges.htm">Propagate Episode Changes</a> for a mechanism for keeping your clip transcripts synchronized with your episode transcript.  The techniques discussed here do not affect the source transcript.)
<P>
If you only need to update the clip transcript in copies of a clip, you can load one copy of the clip into Transana's main interface, edit the clip, and press the <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif" ALT="Change Propagation Button"> button in the transcript toolbar.  Transana will locate all clips taken from the same episode transcript with the same clip ID and the same starting and ending times and will change their transcripts to match.
<P>
If you are interested in making broader changes to all copies of a clips, you can load the clip in the <A HREF="addclip.htm">Clip Properties form</A>, change clip ID, clip transcript, and clip keywords, then press the <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif" ALT="Change Propagation Button"> button.  Transana will locate clips with the clip's original clip ID, and the same clip start and stop times that were created from the same episode transcript and will alter them so that the clip ID, clip transcript, and clip keywords match the current copy of the clip.  Please note that this function does NOT alter the original episode transcript, and it does not affect copies of the clip that have different clip IDs, nor will it remove keywords that designate copies clips as keyword examples.
<P>
The "Review Transcript Changes" screen will be displayed for each copy of the clip Transana is able to identify.  Press "Update" to replace the clip's clip ID, transcript, and keywords and then move on to the next clip copy. "Update All" will apply the transcript changes to all copies of the clip.  (Use this button with caution!) "Skip" will prevent changes from being made to the current clip, while "Cancel" will stop the change propagation process and revert all clip copies back to their original form.  The clip you edited will retain your changes.
<P>
A variety of errors can occur during the clip change propagation process, and the results may differ from what you might expect.  Please take a moment to review the "Clip Change Propagation" report to ensure that all clip copies were correctly updated.  For example, if a clip or a transcript is locked by another user in multi-user Transana, that clip will not be updated.  You will need to wait until the other user releases the record lock, then repeat the change propagation.
