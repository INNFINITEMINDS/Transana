<H1>Merge Keywords</H1><HR>

You may occasionally find it desirable to merge two keywords with each other.  This might occur when you find yourself unable to distinguish between the clips that each keyword represents, or if you find that the two keywords almost always co-occur and don't really seem to represent independent concepts.<P>

To merge keywords, right-click on the keyword you want to merge into the other in the database tree, and choose &quot;Keyword Properties.&quot;  Edit the keyword group and keyword so that they match an existing keyword, the one you want to merge the selected keyword into.  Transana will ask you to confirm that you want to merge the two keywords together, and, if you agree, will merge all instances of the first keyword into the second, eliminating the first keyword and all references to it in the process.<p>

Please note that this is a permanent action that cannot be undone by Transana.<P>
