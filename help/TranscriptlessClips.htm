<H2><I>Media - Clips without Transcripts</I><HR></H2>

It is possible to create Clips without first doing transcription in Transana!<P>

While a transcript can be very useful as a map to your media data, making it easier to find important portions of the events you recorded, transcription is also time-consuming and can be expensive.  If you will be going over your data only once, working under tight time constrictions or with a tight budget, working without transcripts may make sense.  However, if you intend to do careful analysis when you may well go over your media files multiple times or where you want to review "older" data in light of theoretical developments that result from your analysis, creating Transcripts in Transana is highly recommended.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> To create a Standard Clip without a Transcript:<P>

1.  Right-click the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode and choose <B>Add Transcript</B> from the menu.  Type in "Blank Transcript" as the Transcript ID and press <B>OK</B>.<P>

2.  It is often helpful to be able to see the Waveform when working without a Transcript.  Select <B>Options</B> in the Transana Menu, then <B>Media Visualization Style</B>, followed by either <B>Waveform</B> for just the Waveform or <B>Hybrid</B> for both the Waveform and coding information.<P>

3.  It is often helpful to zoom in fairly tightly on the Visualization window when working without a Transcript.  Start at the far left edge of the Visualization, as close to 0:00:00.0 as you can get, hold down your left mouse button, and drag right until you get to about 0:02:00.0.  Release the mouse button, then press the <B>Zoom In</B> <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif"> button in the Visualization toolbar.<P>

4.  Right-click in the Visualization window and listen to the media file as it plays.  Between 0:00:24.2 and 0:01:06.3, you will find a demonstration of how to create a Library in Transana.  Make the matching selection in the Visualization window, using the Waveform and the Visualization Window's "Time:" indicator as a guide.  You can right-click the Visualization Window to play your selection to double-check that your selection is exactly what you want.<P>

5.  Now go down to the Data Window's Database tree and select the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection by clicking on it once.  This is the Collection we want to place the Clip in.<P>

6.  Back in the Visualization Window, press the <B>Create Transcript-less Clip</B> <IMG SRC="images/clipicon.gif"> Button.<P> 

7.  You will now see the <B>Add Clip</B> dialog box.  The Clip start and end points are determined by the selection in the Visualization window, as Transana has no time codes to work with.  <P>

8.  Enter "Create a Library" as the Clip ID and add <B>Tutorial : Library</B> as a Keyword.  Remove <B>Tutorial : Episode</B> from the Clip Keywords list by clicking on it and then pressing the <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"> button.  Press <B>OK</B> to complete the Clip creation process.<p> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> To create a Quick Clip without a Transcript:<P>

1.  Left-click in the Visualization window at 01:06.3, then right-click to listen to the media file starting at that point.  Between 0:01:06.3 and 0:01:54.6, you will find a demonstration of how to create an Episode in Transana.  Make the matching selection in the Visualization window, using the Waveform and the Visualization Window's "Time:" indicator as a guide.  You can right-click the Visualization Window to play your selection to double-check that your selection is exactly what you want.<P>

2.  Now go down to the Data Window's Database tree and select the <B>Tutorial : Episode</B> Keyword by clicking on it once.  This is the Keyword we want to apply to the Quick Clip.<P>

3.  Back in the Visualization Window, press the <B>Create Transcript-less Clip</B> <IMG SRC="images/clipicon.gif"> Button.<P> 

4.  Transana will automatically create a <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection if one does not exist, and will create an automatically named and numbered Quick Clip in that Collection using the Visualization selection to set the start and end points of the Clip and applying the Keyword selected in the Data window to the Clip.<P>
