If this is the first time you have started Transana for a particular database, you should define the database's <B>video root directory</B>.  A video root directory is the base location where Transana should look for media files for a given database.  You can use directories off of the video root, but all media files in the same database should share a common root directory if possible.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Windows Activity:</FONT>To set the video root directory, Go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select <B>Program Settings</B>.  From the <B>Directories</B> tab, set the video root directory setting appropriate for your computer.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Macintosh Activity:</FONT>To set the video root directory, Go to the <B>Transana</B> program menu and select <B>Preferences</B>.  From the <B>Directories</B> tab, set the video root directory setting appropriate for your computer.<P>

<B><I>NOTE:</I></B>  The use of the video root directory is convenient in single-user Transana, but <B>is essential when using multi-user Transana</B>.  This is because it is likely that different computers in a multi-user Transana project will need to refer to the media files in different ways, and each computer relies upon the video root to know how to find the media files.  If you do not use this setting, or if your video root directory points to a different directory than others on the research team, problems can arise.  You will not be able to find the media files others have entered, and others in the team will probably have problems finding the media files you enter.<P>
