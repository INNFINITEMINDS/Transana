The transcript window is where you can view or edit your transcripts.  You can add <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>, which link a frame in the video to a spot in your transcript.  Once this is done, the highlight in the transcript will move as the video is played, highlighting the appropriate section of the transcript, if the transcript is not in &quot;Edit Mode.&quot;  <P>
The transcript window includes speed buttons for inserting symbols commonly used in Jeffersonian Transcript Annotation.  These symbols are <IMG SRC="images/risingintonation.gif"  ALT="risingintonation"   BORDER=0>, which indicates rising intonation, <IMG SRC="images/fallingintonation.gif"  ALT="fallingintonation"   BORDER=0>, which indicates falling intonation, <IMG SRC="images/inhale.gif"  ALT="inhale"   BORDER=0>, which signifies an audible intake of breath, and <IMG SRC="images/whisper.gif"  ALT="whisper"   BORDER=0>, which signifies a whisper or quieted speech.  (See <A HREF="transcriptnotation.htm">Transcript Notation</A> in Transana's Help Menu for more information about Jeffersonian Transcription Symbols.)<P>
The next set of buttons are the Show/Hide Time Codes toggle, denoted by the <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time code</A> icon (<FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>) and the Edit Mode/Read-Only toggle, denoted by the <FONT COLOR="Red"><IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0></FONT> icon.  Please note that the edit button<B> must</B> be pressed, placing the document in Edit Mode, before you can transcribe anything or insert <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>. <P>
The final set of buttons in the Transcript Window speedbar are the Keyword button <IMG SRC="images/keywordsnodeicon.gif"  ALT="keywordsnodeicon"   BORDER=0>, which allows you to edit the Keyword List associated with the currently-loaded Episode or Clip, the Save button <IMG SRC="images/saveicon.gif"  ALT="saveicon"   BORDER=0>, which saves the current transcript, and the Select Clip Text button <IMG SRC="images/selectcliptext.gif"  ALT="selectcliptext"   BORDER=0> which indicates that text highlighted in the Transcript should be selected for creating a Clip.<P>
If you have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript, you can right-click the transcript to play the section between the nearest <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> where the cursor is currently placed.  You can also highlight a larger section of the transcript if you want to play a portion that crosses <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>.  In addition, if you would like to play from the current position in the transcript to the end of the loaded Episode or Clip, you can hold down the Ctrl key and right-click the Transcript on Windows or the Ctrl and &quot;Command&quot; or &quot;Meta&quot; key and click the Transcript on the Mac.<P>
During transcription, you may find it easiest to use Ctrl-S to start and stop video playback.  This causes the video to be played in Transcription Mode, which causes an auto-rewind to be performed when play is initiated.  You can set the amount of the rewind, as well as the playback speed, using the <A HREF="programoptionsmu.htm">Transcriber Settings</A> tab on the Program Settings dialog, which is located in the Options menu.  In addition, Ctrl-D will pause and restart the video playback without auto-rewinding, Ctrl-A will rewind the video by 10 seconds, Ctrl-F will fast-forward the video by 10 seconds, Ctrl-N will cause the next time-coded segment to be played, and Ctrl-P will cause the previous time-coded segment to be played.  Finally, Ctrl-T will cause a time code for the current video position (as indicated in the Sound Visualization Window) to be inserted at the current cursor position in the Transcript.<P>
