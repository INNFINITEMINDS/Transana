<IMG SRC="images/transcriptwindow.gif"  ALT="transcriptwindow"   BORDER=0><P>

The transcript window is where you can view or edit your transcripts.  You can add <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>, which link a frame in the video to a spot in your transcript.  Once this is done, the highlight in the transcript will move as the video is played, highlighting the appropriate section of the transcript (if the transcript is not in &quot;Edit Mode.&quot;)  <P>

The transcript window includes speed buttons for inserting symbols commonly used in Jeffersonian Transcript Annotation.  These symbols are <IMG SRC="images/risingintonation.gif"  ALT="risingintonation"   BORDER=0>, which indicates rising intonation, <IMG SRC="images/fallingintonation.gif"  ALT="fallingintonation"   BORDER=0>, which indicates falling intonation, <IMG SRC="images/inhale.gif"  ALT="inhale"   BORDER=0>, which signifies an audible intake of breath, and <IMG SRC="images/whisper.gif"  ALT="whisper"   BORDER=0>, which signifies a whisper or quieted speech.  (See <A HREF="transcriptnotation.htm">Transcript Notation</A> in Transana's Help Menu for more information about Jeffersonian Transcription Symbols.)<P>

The next set of buttons are the Show/Hide Time Codes toggle, denoted by the <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time code</A> icon <IMG SRC="images/timecode.gif"  ALT="timecodebutton"   BORDER=0>, and the Show/Hide Time Code Values, denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/timecodedata.gif"  ALT="timecodevaluesbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon.  The first of these buttons controls whether the time code <I>symbol</I> is displayed in the transcript, while the second one controls whether the time code <I>value</I>, in human-readable form, is displayed.  (Please note that it is not a good idea to edit the time code value text.  This will not affect the underlying time code, but may cause display problems when Transana tries to hide this automatically-generated text.)<P>

The Edit Mode/Read-Only toggle, denoted by the <IMG SRC="images/editbutton.gif"  ALT="editbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;icon, is next.  Please note that Transana starts up in "read-only" mode, where the highlight selection in the transcript moves with the media file as it plays.  Pressing this button toggles you into the "edit mode," where you can transcribe and insert <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>.  Having the transcript highlight track the media file position is very useful when you are watching or listening to your media file, but when you are editing a transcript, you don't want the cursor moving around in the transcript when you play video, as this is very disruptive to editing.<P>

The next set of buttons in the Transcript Window toolbar are: the Create Quick Clip button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"  ALT="quickclipicon"   BORDER=0>, which allows you to create Quick Clips if you have a Keyword selected in the Database Tree; the Keyword button <IMG SRC="images/keywordsnodeicon.gif"  ALT="keywordsnodeicon"   BORDER=0>, which allows you to edit the Keyword List associated with the currently-loaded Episode or Clip; and the Save button <IMG SRC="images/saveicon.gif"  ALT="saveicon"   BORDER=0>, which saves the current transcript.<P>

The Propagate Changes button is next, as indicated by <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif">, which allows you to push <A HREF="propagateepisodechanges.htm">changes in an episode transcript</A> out to clips covering that portion of the episode or to push <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">changes in a clip transcript</A> out to copies of the currently-loaded clip.<P>

The Match Selection in Other Transcripts button, shown by the <IMG SRC="images/multiselectbutton.gif"> &nbsp;icon, causes all transcript selections to match the one in the selected transcript window when <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple transcripts</A> are open at the same time.  The Play button, shown by the <IMG SRC="images/multiplaybutton.gif"> &nbsp;icon, causes the current selection(s) to be played, which can be particularly useful when creating <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple-transcript clips</A>.<P>

If you have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript, you can right-click the transcript to play the section between the nearest <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> where the cursor is currently placed.  You can also highlight a larger section of the transcript if you want to play a portion that crosses <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A>.  In addition, if you would like to play from the current position in the transcript to the end of the loaded Episode or Clip, you can hold down the Ctrl key and right-click the Transcript on Windows or the Ctrl and &quot;Command&quot; or &quot;Meta&quot; key and click the Transcript on the Mac.<P>

During transcription, you may find it easiest to use <B>Ctrl-S</B> to start and stop video playback.  This causes the video to be played in Transcription Mode, which causes an auto-rewind to be performed when play is initiated.  (You can set the amount of the rewind, as well as the playback speed, using the <A HREF="programoptionsmu.htm">Transcriber Settings</A> tab on the Program Settings dialog, which is located in the Options menu.)  In addition, <B>Ctrl-D</B> will pause and restart the video playback without auto-rewinding, <B>Ctrl-A</B> will rewind the video by 10 seconds, <B>Ctrl-F</B> will fast-forward the video by 10 seconds, <B>Ctrl-N</B> will cause the next time-coded segment to be played, and <B>Ctrl-P</B> will cause the previous time-coded segment to be played.  Finally, <B>Ctrl-T</B> will cause a time code for the current video position (as indicated in the Visualization Window) to be inserted at the current cursor position in the Transcript.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  Some researchers like to use tabs while transcribing in an effort to line up columns of text.  If you would like to use horizontal alignment, here are some helpful hints for this style of transcribing in Transana.<P>

Before you create your transcript, use the Transcriber Settings tab of the <A HREF="ProgramOptionsMU.htm">Program Options dialog</A> to set Transana's Default Font to a fixed width font.  We recommend Courier New font.  You will want to set your Tab Size to be larger than your speaker identifiers.  "T:" works with tab size 4, while "Teacher:" requires a tab size of at least 10.  Finally, be sure to turn Word Wrap off, as you need to set line lengths manually when transcribing this way.   <P>

Once you create your transcript, you need to use only fixed-width fonts, and it is probably easiest if you use only a single size of a single font.  You will also need to limit the length of your lines.  We have found that an upper limit of 80 characters per line if you are using Courier New 10 point font and 64 - 66 characters per line if you are using Courier New 12 point font seems to work well.  You may need to do some experimenting to determine what works best for you.<P>
