When working with media data, the <A HREF="waveforms.htm">Waveform Visualization</A> can be very helpful during transcription and analysis.  However, this is only one of the visualization options Transana offers for Episodes.  The Visualization window can also display information about the coding you have applied to your Episodes through creating and coding Clips and linking Snapshots to Episodes.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  Try this:<P>

1.  If the <B>Transana with Media Data</B> Transcript of the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode is not currently loaded, load it by double-clicking on the Transcript.<P>

2.  Go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select the <B>Media Visualization Style</B> option, then pick the <B>Keyword</B> visualization from the sub-menu.  The Visualization window will switch from the waveform visualization to the Keyword visualization.<P>

This visualization shows coding across the time line of the Episode.  As you mouse over the bars in the visualization, a popup tells you the name of the Keyword represented and the length of the Clip or Snapshot coded with that Keyword.  (Mac users may need to select the Visualization window to be able to see the mouse-over text.)<P>

(If the Visualization window it too small, you may wish to go to <B>Options</B> > <B>Media Size</B> and select a smaller size for the Media window relative to the size of the original media file.)<P>

3.  You can customize the appearance of the visualization extensively.  Press the Filter button <img SRC="images/filterbutton.gif"> in the lower left corner of the Visualization window. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/filterdialog2.gif" ALT="Filter Dialog"><P>

This dialog allows you to select what Keywords are displayed in the Keyword visualization, from what Clips and Snapshots, in what order, and displayed in what colors.  The Options tab allows you to alter the height and spacing of the bars as well.  Note that the Visualization Filter for a Document will have different tabs and options than the Visualizatoin Filter for an Episode.  <P>

4. Click on the Keywords tab in the filter dialog.  Let's modify how Keywords will be displayed in the Visualization.<P>

First, let's sort the Keyword list.  You can select an item in the list by clicking on a Keyword and you can move it relative to other items using the up and down arrows on the right side of the Dialog.  <P>

Second, let's select colors for our Keywords.  You can select an item in the list by clicking on a Keyword and you can assign that Keyword a color by then clicking on a color box at the bottom of the Dialog.  If you click on a Keyword's Color box, or select White for a Keyword's color, that Keyword will be dropped from the Visualization display.<P>

Make whatever adjustments to the Visualization Filter parameters you think make sense.  Then press <B>OK</B>.  Transana will update the visualization to reflect the requested changes.<P>

You can save a Filter configuration you have put together using the <B>Save</B> buttong in the Filter Dialog's Toolbar.  If you name your filter configuration "default" then it will be automatically loaded in the future; otherwise you will need to load it next time you want to use it.<P> 

Transana also offers a <B>Hybrid</B> visualization for media files, which combines both the waveform diagram and the Keyword visualization.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  See <A HREF="filterdialog.htm">filter dialog</A> in the Transana Manual for more information about the options available from the Filter Dialog.<P>
