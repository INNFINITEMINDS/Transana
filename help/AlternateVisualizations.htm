The <A HREF="waveforms.htm">Waveform Visualization</A> can be very helpful during transcription and analysis, but this is only one of the visualization options Transana offers.  The visualization window can also display information about the coding you have applied to your episodes through creating clips and adding keywords to them.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  Try this:<P>

1.  If the <B>Demo</B> episode is not currently loaded, load it by double-clicking on the <B>Transcript</B> transcript in the <B>Demo</B> episode in the <B>Geometry by Design</B> series.<P>

2.  Go to the <B>Options</B> menu and select the <B>Visualization Style</B> option, then pick <B>Keyword</B> from the sub-menu.  The visualization window will switch from the waveform visualization to the keyword visualization.<P>

This visualization shows coding across the time line of an episode.  As you mouse over the bars in the visualization, a popup tells you the name of the keyword represented and the length of the clip coded with that keyword.  (Mac users may need to select the visualization window to be able to see the mouse-over text.)<P>

3.  You can customize the appearance of the visualization to meet your analytic needs.  Press the Filter button <img SRC="images/filterbutton.gif"> in the lower left corner of the visualization window. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/filterdialog2.gif" ALT="Filter Dialog"><P>

This dialog allows you to select what keywords are displayed in the keyword visualization, in what order, shown in what colors.  (The Options tab allows you to alter the height and spacing of the bars as well.)  <FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  See <A HREF="filterdialog.htm">filter dialog</A> in the Transana Manual for more information about the options available from the Filter Dialog.<P>

For illustration purposes we made several changes in teh appearance of the keyword visualization for this data.  Those changes are shown in the following dialog.  First, we moved <B>Teacher Questions</B> to the top of the list.  The teacher's name and the curriculum being used apply to the entire episode, so since they don't really add information to this visualization, we de-selected them so they would not be displayed.  We grouped <B>Confusion</B> and <B>Understanding</B> at the bottom of the list and chose different shades of blue for these related keywords, while we changed the colors of several other keywords to non-blue shades.  Finally, we made sure that the shades being used in the visualization were visually distinct from one another.<P>

Make whatever adjustments to the visualization filter parameters you think make sense.  Then press <B>OK</B>.  Transana will update the visualization to reflect the requested changes.<P>

Transana also offers a <B>Hybrid</B> visualization, which combines both the waveform diagram and the keyword visualization.<P>
