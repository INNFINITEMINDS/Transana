Clips are organized into collections. A collection is simply a container used for holding clips that are somehow related to each other.  In Transana, you need to create at least one collection before you can create your first standard clip.  Otherwise, there is no place to put it.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create a collection. <P>

1. In the Data window, right-click the <B>Collections</B> node, and select <B>Add Collection</B>. You see a dialog box that looks like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/addcollection.gif"  ALT="addcollection"   BORDER=0><P>

2. Type <B>Symmetry</B> in the field labeled <B>Collection ID</B>. <P>

3. Enter your name or initials in the <B>Owner</B> field, and select <B>Tutorial</B> from the <B>Default Keyword Group</B> list.  Click <B>OK </B>when you are done.  Your collection will appear under the Collections root node.<P>

4.  Now right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the <B>Symmetry</B> collection and select <B>Add Collection Note</B> from the popup menu.<P>

5.  Enter <B>Symmetry Collection Purpose</B> in the <B>Note ID</B> and your initials as <B>Note Taker</B>.<P>

6.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into the note and record information about your analytic process, including explaining why you created the collection.  Close the note when you are finished.<P>

NOTE:  At the start of a Grounded Theory analysis, you may not have any idea even what kinds of clips you will be making.  In this case, you can create an atheoretical collection called "Interesting Clips" or "Open Coding" or whatever else you want.  The collection name doesn't need to be theoretically meaningful, but Transana needs a place to store your clips until you figure out what you want to do with them.<P>
