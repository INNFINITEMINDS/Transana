Please note that the Standard version of Transana does not support Quotes.  To use this feature, you must be using the Professionsal, Computer Lab, or Multi-User version of Transana.<P> 

Transana can consolidate two adjacent Quotes into a single Quote.  To initiate this process, right-click a Quote and choose "Merge Quotes" from the popup menu.  Transana displays the Quote's information, along with a list of Quotes that either immediately preceed or immediately follow that Quote in the original Document.<P>

Please note that because of the imprecision of Quote boundaries due to the way computers handle spaces and line breaks, there is a little bit of flexibility in the way Transana defines &quot;adjacent.&quot;  Some editing of the combined text may be required.<P>

Select a Quote from the "Quote to Merge" field, and the form changes to reflect the merged data.  The Quote start or end character changes, the Quote text is combined, and the Quote Keywords are merged.  The Quote ID is not automatically changed, but you can change it if you want to.<P>

You are able to edit the merged Quote as you like.  Then press &quot;OK&quot; to merge the Quotes, &quot;Cancel&quot; to reject the merge, or select a different Quote to merge with the original selection.<P>
