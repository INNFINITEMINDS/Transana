Now that you've gotten your transcript finished and time-coded, you are probably ready for a short break.  Quit Transana.  If you did not save your transcript first, notice that Transana prompts you to save it before the program stops running. When you are ready to return to this tutorial, follow these directions to reload your video.<P>

To reload your video and continue working, the first thing you need to do is locate the transcript you want to work on. Although Transana is designed for analyzing video and audio, you actually do a significant portion of your analytic work from the transcript.  <P>

A single episode might have more than one transcript because it is being analyzed in more than one way.  For example, one transcript may represent field notes, a second transcript could be a verbatim record of the portions that the principle investigator thinks are interesting, and a third, Jeffersonian transcript may cover a different part of the video that a graduate student is analyzing using Conversation Analytic techniques.  In this circumstance, you have one episode, but Transana must know which of the three transcripts you want to work with.  Thus, you load a media file by selecting one of the associated transcripts.<P>
