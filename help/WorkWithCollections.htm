<P>Transana provides several features which allow you to work with collections.</P>

<P><B>Specifying the order of your clips.</B> You can specify the order of the clips in each collection. This is different from most other items listed in the database tree, which are presented in alphabetical order.  When you add a new clip by pasting or dropping transcript text on a collection name, Transana puts the clip at the end of the list of clips within the collection.  If you want to place a new clip in a specific position in the clip list, you can paste or drop the transcript text into the list of clips in the position where you want the new clip to appear.  Transana inserts the new clip above the clip you paste or drop it on.  Existing clips can be reordered using cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop on Windows) within the database tree. You can experiment now with rearranging the clips in your collection.</P>

<P><B>Creating nested collections.</B> Collections can be nested within other collections by right-clicking a collection name and choosing <B>Add Nested Collection</B>.  This allows you to create more complex analytic structures within Transana.  This is often used for categorizing and sorting an existing collection as one's theoretical understanding of one's data develops.</P>

<P><B>Playing all clips.</B> You can play all the clips in a collection in order. This is useful when you want to review all of the clips in a collection to make sure they belong together and have been categorized appropriately.  If you are using Transana for case development, you can create a prototype case by making a collection of the clips you want to include in your final case and ordering them via cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop on Windows.)  Playing all the clips in order will show you roughly what your final case will look like when you are done with the video editing process. To play all clips in a collection in order, right-click the name of the collection in the database tree and choose <B>Play All Clips</B> from the pop-up menu.</P>
