Transana provides several features which allow you to work analytically with data items (Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots) in Collections.<P>

<H3>Manipulating Collections.</H3>  

<A HREF="analysisoverview.htm">As described earlier</A>, one way to conceptualize your analysis is to think of Collections as theoretical constructs and to think of Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots as evidence that supports or refutes the theoretical construct which contains them.  When working in this mode, the manipulation of data items within Collections is an important analytic activity.  <P>

Transana allows you to move and copy Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots from one Collection to another.  Of course, moving a data item and copying that data item are very different analytic acts, but they are accomplished in very similar ways.  Ask yourself if the data item should be copies as evidence both concepts represented by the Collections, or if it should be moved to a more appropriate place in your evolving theoretical structure.<P>

You can right-click a Quote, Clip, or Snapshot and choose <B>Cut</B> for move or <B>Copy</B> for copy, then right-click a different Collection or an item with in a Collection  and choose <B>Paste</B>.  Alternately, you can drag a data item from one Collection and drop it on another Collection or an item in another Collection to move it.  If you hold down the Ctrl key on Windows or the Alt/Option key on OS X during the drop, this changes the drag-and-drop move operation to a drag-and-drop copy operation.  You can also move or copy more than one item at a time.  You can use the Ctrl (on Windows) or Cmd (on OS X) key to multi-select items in a Collection.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these steps to manipulate a Clip in Collections.<P>

1.  If you have been following the Tutorial carefully, you created a transcript-less Quick Clip that demonstrates the process of creating an Episode.  You should have a <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection with a single Clip called <B>Transana with Media Quick Clip 1</B>.  (If you don't have such a Clip, please return to <A HREF="transcriptlessclips.htm">Media - Clips without Transcripts</A> page and complete the final activity listed on that page.)<P>

2.  Let's rename the Quick Clip to give it a more meaningful name.  Right-click it and select <B>Clip Properties</B> from the menu.  Change the Clip ID to <B>Create an Episode</B> and press <B>OK</B> to signal that your changes to the Episode Properties are complete.<P>

3.  Now right-click the <B>Create an Episode</B> Clip and choose <B>Cut</B>.<P>

4.  In the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection, right-click the <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> Clip in the Collection and select <B>Paste</B> from the menu.  (In this case, we want to place the <B>Create an Episode</B> Clip above the selected Clip rather than at the bottom of the list of items in the Collection.  You could also use drag-and-drop to accomplish this.)<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  It is the nature of qualitative analysis that you will find that you occasionally need to change things about your clips, such as the clip name, the clip transcript, or the coding.  When you have multiple copies of a clip, <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">Clip Change Propagation</A> can be very helpful with this process.<P>

<H3>Creating nested Collections.</H3> 

Collections can be nested within other Collections by right-clicking a Collection name and choosing <B>Add Nested Collection</B>.  This allows you to create more complex analytic structures within Transana.  This is often used for categorizing and sorting an existing Collection as one's theoretical understanding of one's data develops.<P>

For example, you might look through your Collection of <B>Teacher Questions</B> and determine that you see the teacher using several different types of questions.  You might create a nested Collection for each type of question, and move (via drag-and-drop or cut-and-paste) the appropriate Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots into those different nested Collections.<P>

Of course, you would document all of this with a combination of Collection Notes, Quote Notes, Clip Notes, and Snapshot Notes as you progress.  During this activity, you are developing and modifying your understanding of teacher questions, and you should take pains to capture the analytic insights that occur during this process in analytic memos, as this will be extremely valuable when you write up the results of your analysis.<P>

<H3>Specifying the order of items within a Collection.</H3> 

You can specify the order of items in a Collection. This is different from most other items listed in the database tree, which are presented in alphabetical order.  When you add a new data item by pasting or dropping on a Collection, Transana puts the new item at the end of the list of items within the Collection.  If you want to place a new item in a specific position in the item list, you can paste or drop the text or data item into the list of existing items in the position where you want the new item to appear.  Transana inserts the new item above the item you paste or drop it on.  Existing items can be reordered using cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop within the Database Tree. <P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these steps to re-order items in a Collection.<P>

1.  Left-click the <B>Create a Library</B> Clip and hold down your mouse button.  Drag this Clip up and drop it on the <B>Create an Episode</B> Clip to change the order of the items in the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.  (You could also use cut-and-paste to accompish this.)<P>  

Being able to set the sort order of items within a Collection is particularly useful when it takes multiple items to fully demonstrate an analytic concept in your data, or when you are doing a narrative analysis where the items need to be able to illustrate a coherent story that relies upon the order of the items in the Collection.<P>

<H3>Playing all Clips.</H3> 

You can play all the Clips in a Collection in order. This is useful when you want to review all of the Clips in a Collection to make sure they belong together and have been categorized appropriately.  Quotes and Snapshots are not included in this process.  (See the <B>Collection Report</B> in<A HREF="">Transana's Reports</A> for an equivalent activity for non-media files<P>

If you are using Transana for media case development, you can create a prototype case by making a Collection of the Clips you want to include in your final case and ordering them via cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop.  Playing all the Clips in order will show you roughly what your final case will look like when you are done with the video editing process. To play all Clips in a Collection in order, right-click the name of the Collection in the Database Tree and choose <B>Play All Clips</B> from the pop-up menu.<P>
