Transana provides several features which allow you to work with collections.<P>

<B>Manipulating collections.</B>  <A HREF="analysisoverview.htm">As described earlier</A>, one way to conceptualize your analysis is to think of collections as theoretical constructs and to think of clips as evidence that supports or refutes the theoretical construct which contains them.  When working in this mode, the manipulation of clips within collections is an important analytic activity.  <P>

Transana allows you to move and copy clips from one collection to another.  Of course, moving a clip and copying a clip are very different from an analytic standpoint, but they are accomplished in very similar ways.  You can right-click a clip and choose <B>Cut</B> for move or <B>Copy</B> for copy, then right-click a different collection or a clip and choose <B>Paste</B>.  Alternately, you can drag a clip from one collection and drop it on another collection or a clip in another colletion to move it.  If you hold down the Ctrl key on Windows or the Alt/Option key on the Mac during the drop, this changes the drag-and-drop operation to a copy operation.<P>

You can also move or copy all of the clips in a collection at once.  To do this, you can drag or cut/copy from one collection and drop/Ctrl-drop/Option(alt)-drop or paste on another collection.  This doesn't move or copy the collection, just all the clips IN the collection.  This makes it possible to aggregate (combine) collections using this mechanism.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  It is the nature of qualitative analysis that you will find that you occasionally need to change things about your clips, such as the clip name, the clip transcript, or the coding.  When you have multiple copies of a clip, <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">Clip Change Propagation</A> can be very helpful with this process.<P>

<B>Creating nested collections.</B> Collections can be nested within other collections by right-clicking a collection name and choosing <B>Add Nested Collection</B>.  This allows you to create more complex analytic structures within Transana.  This is often used for categorizing and sorting an existing collection as one's theoretical understanding of one's data develops.<P>

For example, you might look through your collection of <B>Teacher Questions</B> and determine that you see the teacher using several different types of questions.  You might create a nested collection for each type of question, and move (via drag-and-drop or cut-and-paste) the appropriate clips into those different nested collections.<P>

Of course, you would document all of this with a combination of collection notes and clip notes as you progress.  During this activity, you are developing and modifying your understanding of teacher questions, and you should take pains to capture the analytic insights that occur during this process in analytic memos, as this will be extremely valuable when you write up the results of your analysis.<P>

<B>Specifying the order of your clips.</B> You can specify the order of the clips in each collection. This is different from most other items listed in the database tree, which are presented in alphabetical order.  When you add a new clip by pasting or dropping transcript text on a collection name, Transana puts the clip at the end of the list of clips within the collection.  If you want to place a new clip in a specific position in the clip list, you can paste or drop the transcript text into the list of clips in the position where you want the new clip to appear.  Transana inserts the new clip above the clip you paste or drop it on.  Existing clips can be reordered using cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop within the database tree. You can experiment now with rearranging the clips in your collection.<P>

Being able to set the sort order of clips within a collection is particularly useful when it takes multiple clips to fully demonstrate an analytic concept in your data, or when you are doing a narrative analysis where the clips need to be able to illustrate a coherent story that relies upon the emergent time line that the ordered clips in the collection create.<P>

<B>Playing all clips.</B> You can play all the clips in a collection in order. This is useful when you want to review all of the clips in a collection to make sure they belong together and have been categorized appropriately.  If you are using Transana for case development, you can create a prototype case by making a collection of the clips you want to include in your final case and ordering them via cut-and-paste or drag-and-drop.  Playing all the clips in order will show you roughly what your final case will look like when you are done with the video editing process. To play all clips in a collection in order, right-click the name of the collection in the database tree and choose <B>Play All Clips</B> from the pop-up menu.<P>
