It is common in qualitative analysis to end up with a lot of analytic memos that contain a lot of information about the analysis you have performed.  Transana provides the <B>Notes Browser</B> to make it easier for researchers to review their notes so that they can harvest insights and ideas from them during the writing of results and other times during the analytic process.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  To access the Notes Browser, go to the <B>Tools</B> menu and select <B>Notes Browser</B>.<P>

The notes browser organizes your notes by type, showing all of the collection notes as a group, all of the clips notes as a group, etc.  This allows you to move through similar types of notes more quickly.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  Click on a note to display the note text in the Notes Browser's right-hand pane. <P>

You can edit the note there if desired.  You can also right-click the note in the left-hand pane to get a popup menu of options for manipulating notes, including being able to locate notes in the database tree and open clips for review.<P>

You can also search for text across notes to find notes that you are looking for more easily.  For example, it is common to have ideas for further exploration of your data during your analytic work, ideas that you want to follow up on later so as not to interrupt your current train of thought.  You might record such ideas in your notes and flag them with the phrase "Follow Up" to make them easier to find later.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  Click on the <B>Note Search</B> tab in the Notes Browser.  Type "Follow up" in the <B>Search Text</B> box, then press the <B>Search</B> button.<P>

Only notes that contain the appropriate text will be included in the Notes window below the search box.  To see all of your notes again, return to the <B>Notes</B> tab.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Activity:</FONT>  From the Notes tab, right-click any of the root nodes (Series, Episode, Transcript, Collection, or Clip.)  Each node has its own <B>Notes Report</B> showing the notes under that that node.  If you right-click the main Database node, you can get a <B>Notes Report</B> that includes all notes in your database.  The <A HREF="Filter.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to select a subset of notes to be included in the report if desired.  The report can also be saved as a Rich Text Format document and can be printed.<P>

It is also possible to including clip notes in <A HREF="reports.htm">Episode Report</A> and to include clip and collection notes in the <A HREF="reports.htm">Collection Report</A> by selecting that option through the <A HREF="filter.htm">filter dialog</A>.<P>
