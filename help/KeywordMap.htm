The Keyword Map presents a visual display of where keywords have been assigned to Clips created from the selected Episode.  Each colored band in the Keyword Map shows the start and stop points of a Clip, along the horizontal timeline of the Episode, where a particular keyword, along the vertical axis, has been applied.  Bands of the same color with the same starting and ending points indicate that a single clip was assigned multiple keywords.  A tri-color band indicates where multiple clips have been coded with the same keyword at the same time period.<P>

If you hold your cursor over a band in the Keyword Map, you will see a popup hint that indicates the name and length of the clip that band represents.  Left-clicking on a band will load the appropriate clip in Transana and close the Keyword Map, while right-clicking a band will load the clip, leaving the Keyword Map open but moving it to the background.<P>

The Keyword Map has several options in its toolbar (and the menu on Windows only.)  You can customize the content using the <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A>.  You can save a copy of the Keyword Map diagram in JPEG format.  The JPEG image created will have the same width and at least the same height as the Keyword Map window on the screen, so you may want to resize the window prior to saving your image.  Similarly, the dimensions of the window on screen affect the overall shape of the printout when Print Preview or Print is selected from the toolbar or menu.  Some experimentation may be required to get the exact image size and proportions you desire in a saved graphic or a printout.<P>
