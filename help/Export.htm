<H1>Export Database</H1><HR>

To export an entire Transana database for transfer to another computer, go to the Tools menu and select &quot;Export Database.&quot;  You then enter the name you want to give to the data file.  This file will have a &quot;.tra&quot; file extension to indicate that it is in Transana-XML format.<P>

At this time, only entire Transana databases can be exported.  Export of parts of a database, such as only a particular collection, is not yet supported.<P>

To transfer this data to another computer, you will need to copy the Transana-XML file created by the Export Database routine, as well as all related media files that the new computer does not already have access to, to the new computer.  You will then need to run the &quot;<A HREF="import.htm">Import Database</A>&quot; routine on the new computer.<P>

The Transana-XML file produced by this routine in intended only for use by Transana.  It is generally not a good idea to try to edit this file unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Because of the way time codes are represented within transcripts, Transana-XML is not considerer to be &quot;well-formed&quot; XML and will not be viewable or editable by most XML editing programs.<P>
