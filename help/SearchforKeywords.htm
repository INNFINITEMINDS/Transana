<H2><I>Searching for Keywords<HR ></I></H2><P>
Transana lets you search for clips and episodes that contain specified keywords. This is useful when you want to look for evidence to support a certain hypothesis, especially when you have large amounts of video data.<P>
Searches have names, and, once created, they appear in reverse chronological order under the Search node in the database tree. This lets you keep track of what you've searched for, and what you found when you searched. You can save the results of a search as a collection. <P>

1. Right-click the <B>Search</B> node in the database tree in the Data window and choose <B>Search</B> from the pop-up menu. Transana opens the Boolean Keyword Search dialog box<P>

This search produced four clips, which you can review by right-clicking the <B>Symmetry</B> collection under the <B>Symmetry and Confusion</B> Search Result node and selecting <B>Play All Clips</B>.  In one clip, a student talks about the carpet being symmetrical if it's all gray. In the second, a student suggests that symmetry may have something to do with houses.  In the third,  the class discusses symmetry as meaning things that are the same, and in the fourth, the teacher is asking about how students will know if they can always create symmetrical two-by-two designs.<P>
The clip <B>Proof</B> in this instance is a false positive result. In this clip, the students are clear about the concept of symmetry, but are expressing confusion about the broader implication of their initial finding that they can always create symmetrical two-by-two designs.  Let's drop it from your Search Result (but not from its Collection) by right-clicking the clip in the search result and selecting <B>Drop for Search Result</B> from the pop-up menu.<P>
