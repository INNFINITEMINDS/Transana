<P>Transana provides a variety of reports that allow you to explore the clips you've created and the coding you've applied to your media files using keywords.</P>

<H3>Series Report</H3>

<P>The <B>Series Report</B> produces a list of episode keywords for all episodes in the selected series. This allows you to review the default keywords you have assigned to all episodes in a series.  To generate a Series Report, right-click the name of a series in the database tree and choose <B>Series Report</B> from the pop-up menu. This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what episodes and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.</P>

<H3>Episode Report</H3>

<P>The <B>Episode Report</B> produces a list of all clips created from the selected episode, and can optionally include clip transcripts, clip keywords, and clip comments. To generate an Episode Report, right-click the name of an episode in the database tree and choose <B>Episode Report</B> from the pop-up menu. This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what data elements should be shown, and what clips and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Collection Report.</P>

<H3>Collection Report</H3>

<P>The <B>Collection Report</B> produces a list of all clips gathered together in the specified collection, and can optionally include clip transcripts, clip keywords, and clip comments. To generate a Collection Report, right-click the name of a collection in the database tree and choose <B>Collection Report</B> from the pop-up menu. This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what data elements should be shown, and what clips and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  By default, clips in nested collections are included in the report, though this can be changed through the filter dialog.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Episode Report.</P>

<H3>Notes Report</H3>

<P>The <B>Notes Reports</B> are available from within the <A HREF="NotesBrowser.htm">Notes Browser</A> tool.  You can produce reports for notes associated with Series records, Episode records, Transcript records, Collection records, Clip records, or all notes in a database.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify which notes are included in the report.</P>
