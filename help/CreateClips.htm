<H2><I>Media - Creating Standard Clips</I><HR></H2>

Once you've created a Collection, you can create a standard Clip. Make sure you have the <B>Transana with Media</B> Transcript of the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode loaded and selected in Transana's main interface.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create a Standard Clip.<P>

1.  Make sure that time codes are visible in your transcript.  They should be, by default.<P>

2. Scroll down to the <B>Standard Clips</B> section of the Transcript in the Document window.  The first couple of paragraphs talk about creating a Collection, which we have already done.  Look for a paragraph that states "Once you have a selection, then you can double-click the Collection that you'd like to place your Standard Clip in to trigger Standard Clip creation" and select (highlight) that sentence by clicking the start of the sentence, holding your left mouse button down, dragging to the end of the sentence, and releasing the mouse button.<P>

2. Leaving that selection in place in the Transcript, move your mouse cursor to the Data window and double-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.<P>

3.  You now see the Add Clip dialog box:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/addclip1.gif" BORDER=0><P>

4. Enter <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> in the <B>Clip ID </B>field.  <P>

5. Notice that your Clip is automatically assigned the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Episode</B>, which is the Keyword that you assigned to the Episode from which this Clip was created.  We could add more Keywords to the Clip here if we wanted, but let's wait to do that.<P>

6. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

Note this about time codes: The video portion of the Clip will extend from the time code preceding your selection in the Transcript to the time code following it.  If your selection starts or ends within text that is not near a time code, you may get a larger portion of your media file than you intended.<P>

The Clip's Transcript will reflect only what you have highlighted.  Therefore, it is quite easy to include more media than text unless you place time codes at the precise beginning and end of the section you want to include in the Clip.  As a general rule, it is a good idea to place time codes at exact points where you would like your Clip to start and end as the first step in creating a Clip.  This is covered in more detail later in the Tutorial.<P>

Clips can extend over several time-coded segments of your Transcript without difficulty by making a Transcript selection that spans over time codes.<P>

One additional detail:  If you want to make a clip that includes all the Transcript text between two consecutive time codes, you don't need to actually select the text.  Just click somewhere in the text and create your Clip.  When Clip creation is triggered without a text selection, Transana will automatically select the text between the time codes on either side of the Transcript cursor.<P>

7.  Now right-click your new <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> Clip and choose <B>Add Clip Note</B> from the popup menu.  Enter <B>Create Clip by double-clicking Collection</B> as the Note ID and your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.  Press "OK".<P>

8.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into your Note, then enter analytic process information about the creation of the Clip.  Close the Note when you are finished.<P>

Note that your analytic memos are a place where you can record ideas for future investigation as they come up, but if you do this, you will want to flag them with an identical tag ("FOLLOW UP" in this instance.)  This makes it much easier to find them in the future using the Notes Browser's Text Search capability.<P>

If you want to make a Clips that includes a full time-coded segment from a Transcript, you don't need to actually select the text.  Just place the Transcript cursor somewhere in the time-coded segmetn and create your Clip.  Transana will automatically select the entire time-coded segment in the absence of a selection.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create another standard Clip in a different way.<P>

1. Look for the sentence that states 'Or, you can right-click that Collection and choose "Add Clip" from the menu.' and place the Transcript cursor in it by clicking somewhere in the time-coded segment.  You do not need to make a selection, as we want the entire segment.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/demotranscript2.gif" BORDER=0><P>

2. Right-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection and select "Add Clip" from the popup menu.<P>

3. You now see the Add Clip dialog box, similar to the one shown above (but with different Clip Text.<P>

4. Enter <B>Create Clip by right-clicking Collection</B> in the <B>Clip ID </B>field.  <P>

5. Notice that your Clip is automatically assigned the keyword <B>Tutorial : Episode</B>, which is the keyword that you assigned to the Episode from which this Clip was created.  We would like to add a Keyword that identifies this as a Clip, but no such Keyword exist.  Fortunately, we can add new Keywords while in the midst of creating a Clip.<P>

6.  Press the "Keyword Management" button, which looks like this <IMG SRC="images/KeywordManagementButtonProperties.gif">, on the Add Clip form.  This will open the Keyword Management tool.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagement.gif"><P>

7.  Press the "Add Keyword to List" button and add a "Tutorial : Clip" Keyword.  Press "OK" to close the "Add Keyword" dialog and "Close" to close the "Keyword Management" form.  You now have a "Clip" Keyword in the "Tutorial" Keyword Group.  Double-click it to add it to the Clip Keywords list.<P>   

8. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

9.  Now right-click your new <B>Create Clip by right-clicking Collection</B> Clip and choose <B>Add Clip Note</B> from the popup menu.  Enter <B>Create Clip by right-clicking Collection</B> as the Note ID and your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.<P>

10.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into your Note, then enter analytic process information about the creation of the Clip.  Close the Note when you are finished.<P>

We need several Clips for demonstration purposes later in the Tutorial, so let's create one more.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create another standard Clip in a different way.<P>

1. Look for the sentence that states " Or, you can drag the text from the Transcript and drop it on the Collection." and select that sentence.<P>

2. Now click on the Transcript selection, holding down your left mouse button, and drag the selection onto the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection in the Data window.<P>

3. Once again, you see the Add Clip dialog box.  Enter <B>Create Clip by dragging selection to Collection</B> in the <B>Clip ID </B>field.  <P>

4. Add a "Tutorial : Clip" Keyword.  Click <B>OK.</B><P>

5.  Add an appropriate Clip Note to document your analytic process.<P>

You now have a Collection containing three Clips.  They were all taken from the same Episode and Transcript, but were created in slightly different ways.<P>
