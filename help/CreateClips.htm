Once you've created a collection, the next step is to populate the collection with clips. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to find the first clip that relates to symmetry.<P>

1. The first direct mention of symmetry occurs at about 2:42 in the video.  Navigate to that point in the Visualization window, and look for the section of the transcript where the teacher tells the students to write down the word &quot;symmetry,&quot; and their thoughts about its definition.  <P>

2. Make sure that time codes are visible in your transcript, then use the mouse to click and drag the cursor to highlight the sentence about writing a definition of symmetry.  Note that if that section of the transcript was ALREADY highlighted, you'll may need to click somewhere else in the transcript to clear the selection, then click and drag your mouse to highlight the teacher's words about symmetry. <P>

3. <FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:  </FONT>Now move your mouse pointer over the highlight , hold down your left mouse button, drag the highlighted text to the Collection named <B>Symmetry</B> in the database tree, and release the mouse button. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:  </FONT>Right-click the Collection where you want to create the Clip and select &quot;Add Clip&quot;.<P>

You see the Add Clip dialog box:<P>

4. Enter <B>Introduction</B> in the <B>Clip ID </B>field.  <P>

5. Notice that your clip is automatically assigned the keywords <B>Geometry</B> and <B>Quilt</B>, which are the keywords that you assigned to the Episode from which this clip was created.  Double-click <B>Symmetry</B> to add that keyword to this clip.<P>

6. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

Note this about time codes: The video portion of the clip will extend from the time code preceding your selection in the transcript to the time code following it, unless your selection begins or ends with a time code.  If your selection starts or ends within text that is not near a time code, you may get more video than you intended.  Clips can extend over several time-coded segments of your transcript without difficulty.<P>

Also note that the Clip text, or Clip Transcript, will only reflect what you have highlighted.  Therefore, it is quite easy to include more video than text unless you place time codes at the precise beginning and end of the section you want to convert into a Clip.  As a general rule, it is a good idea to place time codes at exact points where you would like your Clip to start and end as the first step in creating a Clip.  This is covered in more detail later in the Tutorial.<P>
