<H2><I>Creating Standard Clips</I><HR></H2>

Once you've created a collection, you can create a standard clip. Make sure you have your transcript of the Demo video loaded in Transana's main interface to start with.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to find the first clip that relates to symmetry.<P>

1. The first direct mention of symmetry occurs at about 2:42 in the video.  Navigate to that point in the Visualization window, or you can use the text search box in the transcript toolbar to search for "symm" (so you can find references to symmetry, symmetrical, etc.)  Look for the section of the transcript where the teacher tells the students to write down the word &quot;symmetrical,&quot; and their thoughts about its definition.  <P>

2. Make sure that time codes are visible in your transcript, then use the mouse to click and drag the cursor to highlight the sentence about writing a definition of symmetry.  Note that if that section of the transcript was ALREADY highlighted, you'll may need to click somewhere else in the transcript to clear the selection, then click and drag your mouse to highlight the teacher's words about symmetry. <P>

3. <FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:  </FONT>Now move your mouse pointer over the highlight , hold down your left mouse button, drag the highlighted text to the Collection named <B>Symmetry</B> in the database tree, and release the mouse button. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:  </FONT>Right-click the <B>Symmetry</B> Collection and select &quot;Add Clip&quot; from the popup menu.<P>

You see the Add Clip dialog box:<P>

4. Enter <B>Introduction</B> in the <B>Clip ID </B>field.  <P>

5. Notice that your clip is automatically assigned the keywords <B>C. Curtis</B> and <B>Geometry by Design</B>, which are the keywords that you assigned to the Episode from which this clip was created.  We could add more keywords to the clip here if we wanted, but let's wait to do that.<P>

6. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

Note this about time codes: The video portion of the clip will extend from the time code preceding your selection in the transcript to the time code following it, unless your selection begins or ends with a time code.  If your selection starts or ends within text that is not near a time code, you may get more video than you intended.  Clips can extend over several time-coded segments of your transcript without difficulty by making a transcript selection that spans over time codes.<P>

Also note that the clip's transcript will reflect only what you have highlighted.  Therefore, it is quite easy to include more video than text unless you place time codes at the precise beginning and end of the section you want to convert into a Clip.  As a general rule, it is a good idea to place time codes at exact points where you would like your Clip to start and end as the first step in creating a Clip.  This is covered in more detail later in the Tutorial.<P>

One additional detail:  If you want to make a clip that includes all the transcript text between two consecutive time codes, you don't need to actually select the text.  Just click somewhere in the text, then right-click a collection and select <B>Add Clip</B> from the popup menu.  When clip creation is triggered without a text selection, Transana will automatically select the text between the two nearest time codes.<P>

7.  Now right-click your new <B>Introduction</B> clip and choose <B>Add Clip Note</B> from the popup menu.  Enter <B>Symmetry Introduction Clip Note</B> as the Note ID and your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.<P>

8.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into your note, then enter analytic process information about the creation of the clip.  Close the note when you are finished.<P>

Note that your analytic memos are a place where you can record ideas for future investigation as they come up, but if you do this, you will want to flag them with an identical tag ("FOLLOW UP" in this instance.)  This makes it much easier to find them in the future using the Notes Browser's Text Search capability.<P>
