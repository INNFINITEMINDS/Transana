<H1>Copy and Move<HR ></H1><P>
As you might guess, Copy copies one or more files from one side to the other, while Move copies the files and then deletes them from their original locations.  Simply select one or more files in one window, select to the desired destination folder or collection in the other window, and press the appropriate Copy or Move button.  If you are copying between your local system and a SRB, you will see a Transfer Progress window.  No progress bar appears if you are copying or moving files between two folders in the same location.<P>
