<H1>Propagate Episode Transcript Changes</H1><HR>

You will most likely need to change existing transcripts at some point during your analysis.  However, when you create a clip in Transana, you create a copy of the transcript, so changes in your episode transcript are not automatically reflected in your clips.  (There are some analytic circumstances where you may want a clip transcript to differ from the originating episode transcript.)  However, there are many instances where it would be nice to be able to make a transcript edit once and have the changes show up in multiple places.<P>

The &quot;Propagate Episode Transcript Changes&quot; function allows a researcher to synchronize episode transcripts with clip transcripts created from the Episode Transcript if desired.  When you make a change to an episode transcript that you would like to propagate out to the relevant clips, place your transcript cursor within the edited segment and press the <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif" ALT="Change Propagation Button"> &nbsp;button in the <A HREF="transcriptwindow.htm">Transcript window</A> toolbar.<P>

(Please see <A HREF="propagateclipchanges.htm">Propagate Clip Changes</a> for a mechanism for keeping copies of clips synchronized with each other without editing the Episode Transcript.)<P>

The &quot;Review Transcript Changes&quot; screen will be displayed for each clip created from the same transcript that overlaps the current transcript position.  Press &quot;Update&quot; to replace the clip's current transcript with the new transcript. &quot;Update All&quot; will apply the transcript changes to all clips from the same transcript that overlap the current cursor position.  (Use this button with caution!) &quot;Skip&quot; will prevent changes from being made to the current clip, while &quot;Cancel&quot; will stop the change propagation process and revert all clips to their original form.<P>

This process sometimes yields results that differ from what you might expect.  When you look at the &quot;Selected Clips&quot; tab in the data window, it shows you all of the clips that have been defined that include the current time position of the current episode.  However, you cannot assume that Transana will (or should) update all of these clips if you select &quot;Propagate Episode Transcript Changes.&quot;  Instead, take a moment to review the &quot;Episode Transcript Change Propagation&quot; report.<P>

If you have multiple transcripts for an episode, only those clips derived from the current transcript will be updated.  If you want to update clips derived from another episode transcript, update the other transcript and then select the propagate button.<P>

If the time codes in a transcript have changed, Transana may not be able to locate the exact starting or ending points for a clip.  If this occurs, the clip will not be updated during change propagation.  It is a good idea to avoid deleting time codes once you have started creating clips from a transcript.<P>

If a clip transcript is locked by another user in Transana Multiuser, that clip transcript will also not be updated.  You will need to wait until the other user releases the record lock, then repeat the change propagation.<P>

NOTE:  If you are in a clip when you notice the need to change your transcript, right-click the clip in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">data window</A>'s database tree and choose &quot;Locate Clip in Episode.&quot;  Edit the episode transcript.  Then press the <IMG SRC="images/propagatebutton.gif" ALT="Change Propagation Button"> &nbsp;button to propagate the transcript changes out to the appropriate clips.<P>
