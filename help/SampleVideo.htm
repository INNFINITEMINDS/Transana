This tutorial describes the transcription and analysis of a sample video file, Demo.mpg. This file is available on the Downloads page on the Transana Web Site (http://www.transana.org).  If you have not already done so, you should download this video now. Later in the Tutorial, you will be instructed to browse to this video file, so make sure you know where to find it when you need it!<P>

The sample video shows a second grade class learning geometry through a quilt design and construction activity.  In this tutorial, you transcribe the short video and analyze it to explore the students' emerging understanding of symmetry.<P>

The subject of preparing video or audio files for analysis with Transana is beyond the scope of this Tutorial.  There are resources on this topic in the Documentation section on the Transana Web Site (http://www.transana.org) and there are sections of the User Forums dedicated to creating media files on different platforms.<P>
