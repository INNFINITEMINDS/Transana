There are several advanced issues that are helpful to understand in working with time codes.  If this is your first time through the Tutorial and you are currently feeling a bit overwhelmed, you may choose to skip this page.  If so, please come back later when you feel like you understand things better.<P>

<H3>Timed Pauses / Timed Segments</H3>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  You may find it useful to be able to time the duration of certain events within your media files.  For example, it is common to time pauses in conversation in Conversation Analysis, or you might want to time periods of laughter while studying humor.<P>

To time a segment in Transana, take the following steps:<P>

1.  Make a rough selection in the Visualization Window around the area you are interested in, being sure to leave some margin on either side, and zoom in by pressing the <IMG SRC="images/zoomin.gif">&nbsp; button.<P>

2.  Make a precise selection within the Visualization Window of the segment of your media file you want to time.  It often takes several attempts to get the exact selection, using right-clicking in the Visualization to listen to the current selection.  (Please note that the waveform visualization can be imprecise, and that some media formats respond more quickly to Transana's start and stop commands than others, so we recommend you rely on your ears rather than your eyes for making the final selection.)<P>

3.  Click in the Transcript in the Document Window (which must be in edit mode) at the location where you would like the indication of the timed segment to be inserted.<P>

4.  Press the &quot;Selected&quot; button in the toolbar at the bottom of the Visualization Window.<P>

Transana will insert two time codes, with the time measurement (accurate to the 1/10th of a second) between these time codes.<P>

<H3>Overlapping Speech</H3>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  There are models for indicating overlapping speech in Transcripts that are great on paper but that don't quite work when you try to connect the Transcript to a media file the way Transana does.  Time codes in Transana must be in linear order in the Transcript, which affects the way overlapping speech should be represented.<P>

In the screen shot below, you see an example where the teacher is talking, the student begins talking before the teacher stops talking, and then the student continues on following the overlap.  Note that the transcript shows time codes precisely at the beginning of the overlap and at the end of the overlap, as well as indicating the overlap with square brackets.  It is also important to note that the flow of the conversation remains linear with respect to time in the transcript.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/overlap.gif"><P>

When the person who was speaking before an overlap continues after the overlap, their post-overlap speech needs to be continued on the line below the overlap; it cannot be finished on the same line as the pre-overlap talk because that would break temporal linearity in the transcript and require time codes to be out of order.<P>

<H3>Precise Control of Media File Position</H3>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced Topic:</FONT>  In some circumstances, very precise positioning of the media file is helpful in placing time codes.  For example, someone creating a gestural transcript may need to record precisely when individual gestures begin and end.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT> Click in the Visualization Window.  Press the cursor-left and cursor-right keys.<P>

You will notice that this moves your video file just a little bit to earlier or later.  To be precise, the visualization cursor is moved one pixel to the left or right.  How much time this represents in your media file depends on the length of your media file and on the width of the visualization window on your screen.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT> Click in the Visualization Window.  Hold down the Shift key and press the cursor-left and cursor-right keys.<P>

You will notice that this moves your video file exactly one second earlier or later.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT> Click in the Visualization Window.  Hold down the Alt key and press the cursor-left and cursor-right keys.<P>

You will notice that this moves your video file exactly one half second earlier or later.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT> Click in the Visualization Window.  Hold down the Ctrl key and press the cursor-left and cursor-right keys.<P>

You will notice that this moves your video file one frame earlier or later.  <P>
