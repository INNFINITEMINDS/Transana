Once you have used Transana to transcribe and analyze your data, the final step is to share what you have found with others.  To facilitate this, Transana has a presentation mode, designed to help you share your analytic data with others.<P>

In presentation mode, Transana can use the full screen to play a video, can display only the video window (across the top of the screen) and the transcript window (across the bottom), or can play your video's audio while displaying a transcript but hiding the video window.  This last mode is useful when subject confidentiality is an issue and you feel it would be better to avoid showing your subject's face.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>To use presentation mode, follow these directions. <P>

1. On the <B>Options</B> menu, click <B>Presentation mode</B>. Then click <B>Video Only</B>. <P>

2. Double-click the name of a clip (<B>Houses</B>, for example) and click the play button on the Video window control bar. Transana uses the entire monitor to play the clip. When the clip finishes playing, the other windows return.<P>

Try selecting <B>Video and Transcript Only</B> instead of <B>Video Only</B>. Notice the transcript window at the bottom of the screen. If the transcript text is not large enough for your intended audience, you may wish to enlarge the text in your clip trancript(s) prior to doing your presentation.<P>

Now try <B>Audio and Transcript Only</B> with a video clip.<P>

To return to regular operation, on the <B>Options</B> menu, click <B>Presentation mode</B>, then click <B>All Windows.</B><P>
