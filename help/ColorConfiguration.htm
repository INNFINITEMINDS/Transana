Graphics Color Configuration allows you to define the colors that should be used in Transana's <A HREF="keywordmap.htm">Keyword Map</A>, <A HREF="SeriesMap.htm">Series Keyword Maps and Graphs</A>, and the detail coding for <A HREF="snapshotwindow.htm">Snapshots</A>.<P>

The top part of this dialog is the current color list.  If you select an item in this list, you can move it up or down relative to the other values using the arrow keys to the right of the list.<P>

Below the color list is the color definition bar.  Note that when you select a color in the list, the color definition bar is automatically filled with the values for that color.  This is helpful when you want to create a new color that is similar to one that has already been defined, or when you want to change an existing color.<P>

The color definition bar is made up of a color selector button, a color name, a color's hex value, and values for the color's blend of red, green, and blue.  Pushing the color selector button allows you to use the standard color selection tool for your operating system to select a color.  If you edit the Hex value, Red, Green, and Blue will be updated, and if you edit Red, Green, and Blue, the Hex value will be updated.  When you have a valid color definition, you can then add a new color to the list by pressing the "Add" button or you can substiture the color definition for the currently selected color values by pressing the "Edit" button.<P>

Finally, you can create different color configurations by saving and loading different sets of colors.  Transana will remember the name of the color configuration file you are using and will automatically re-load your color configuration the next time you start Transana.<P>
