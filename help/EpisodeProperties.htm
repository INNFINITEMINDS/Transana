An <A HREF="organization.htm">Episode</A> in Transana is a data object that links one or more media files with one or more <A HREF="transcriptproperties.htm">Transcripts</A>.  Episodes hold a pointer to the media file(s) selected when they are created, so media files should not be renamed after being added to Transana.  If you move your media files, you can use the <a href="filemanagement.htm">File Management</a> tool to update file locations in the database.<P>

To add an <A HREF="organization.htm">Episode</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) a named <A HREF="libraryproperties.htm">Library</A> in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Episode.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is an &quot;Episode ID&quot; which must be unique within that Library and a &quot;Media Filename&quot; that identifies the video or audio file you wish to work with.  &quot;Date&quot; should identify the date the media file was recorded, if known, and is especially helpful when working with large collections of media files.  &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  The &quot;Library ID&quot; and the &quot;Length&quot; field are filled in automatically by Transana and cannot be edited. <P>

By selecting a Keyword Group and Keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each Episode.  These Keywords are default codes, and are optionally applied to all Clips created from the Episode. Selecting a Keyword Group : Keyword combination in the Keywords list and pressing <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;removes a keyword from the list, and pressing <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;allows you to access <A HREF="keywordmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>.<P>

Please note that all Media Filenames must be unique at the file name level.  That is, once you have created an Episode from a media file with a given name, do not use the same media file name to represent a different piece of video or audio media for analysis in Transana, even if that media file is stored in a different folder on your computer.<P>

Note that Transana is able to display up to four media files simultaneously, if your computer is powerful enough.  See <A HREF="multimedia.htm">Working with Multiple Media Files</A> for more information on this feature.<P>
