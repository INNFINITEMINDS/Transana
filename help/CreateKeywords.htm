<H2><I>Creating Keyword Groups and Keywords</I><HR></H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>
As you probably know, <B><I>coding</I></B> is a central activity in many forms of qualitative analysis.  While it would be unusual to start a qualitative analysis with a well-developed coding scheme, it is not at all unusual to want to identify source files with some of their primary characteristics from the beginning of the analytic process.  There are often some initial codes that apply to an entire source data file that a researcher wants to make sure get applied throughout analysis.  In education research, the name of the teacher, the school, the classroom subject or grade level, and the curriculum being used are common examples.  <P>

This is where we will begin working with Transana.  The Demonstration data consists of three files; a text document describing the analysis of text in Transana, a video file describing the analysis of media in Transana, and a photograph that lends itself to simple qualitative analysis.  During the Tutorial analysis, you will create a small database that documents the initial stages of the analytic process within Transana to which you can refer later should you need a refresher.<P>

<H3>Keywords</H3>

Let's start by creating some Keywords that describe the different data item types one encounters in Transana.<P>

In Transana, you use the Data window to create and manage Keywords in order to develop a coding system. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions (Macintosh single-button mouse users, remember that Control-click emulates right-click):<P>

1. To create a Keyword Group, right-click the <B>Keywords</B> node in the database tree, then click <B>Add Keyword Group</B>.<P>

You see the following dialog box:<P>

2. Enter <B>Tutorial</B> as the Keyword Group name and click OK.  Transana creates your first Keyword Group.<P>

(Please note that this Keyword Group will not be saved in the Transana database until you put some Keywords in it!  If you quit Transana right now, that group will not exist when you restart the program.)<P>

3. The next step is to add a Keyword to this group. Right-click the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group, then click <B>Add Keyword </B>from the resulting menu.  Type in the Keyword "Document".  Under the optional definition, we might include a description that says that a Document is a source text file that has been brought into Transana for analysis.  We will ignore the other fields for the moment.  When done, click OK to save the Keyword.<P>

4. Now add the keyword <B>Episode</B>, defined as representing one or more overlapping media files brought into Transana for analysis.  Add another for <B>Library</B>, described as an organizational node for grouping source Documents and Episodes, <B>Transcript</B>, defined as a written representation of the contents of an Episode, and <B>Keyword</B>, defined as a tag used for coding analytic data within Transana.  Note that each keyword is added to the database tree as you enter it.<P>

5.  Now right-click the Keywords node in the Database Tree and select the <B>Keyword Summary Report</B> option from the menu.  You will see a listing of the Keywords you have created, organized by Keyword Group, including your Keyword definitions.  <P>

This report can be a very useful as a coding dictionary for your project.  You can produce a similar report for a specific Keyword Group by right-clicking the Keyword Group and selecting the <B>Keyword Summary Report</B> option.<p>
