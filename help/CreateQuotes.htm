<H2><I>Text - Creating Standard Quotes</I><HR></H2>

If you are using the Standard version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Working with text data is only supported in the Professional, Computer Lab, and Multi-User versions of Transana.<P>

Once you've created a Collection, you can create a Standard Quote. Make sure you have the "Transana with Text" Document loaded and selected in the Document window to start with.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create a Standard Quote.<P>

1. Scroll down to the <B>Standard Quotes</B> section of the Document.  The first paragraphs talk about creating a Collection, which we have already done.  Look for a paragraph that states, "You can double-click the Collection you'd like to place your Standard Quote in to trigger Standard Quote creation" and select (highlight) that sentence by clicking the start of the sentence, holding your left mouse button down, dragging to the end of the sentence, and releasing the mouse button.<P>

2. Leaving that selection in place in the Document window, move your mouse cursor to the Data window and double-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.<P>

3. You now see the Add Quote dialog box:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/addquote1.gif" BORDER=0><P>

4. Enter "Create Quote by double-clicking Collection" in the <B>Quote ID </B>field.  <P>

5. Notice that your Quote is automatically assigned the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Document</B>, which is the Keyword that you assigned to the Document from which this Quote was created.  We could add more Keywords to the Quote here if we wanted, but let's wait to do that.<P>

6. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

7.  Now right-click your new <B>Create Quote by double-clicking Collection</B> Quote and choose <B>Add Quote Note</B> from the popup menu.  Enter "Create Quote by double-clicking Collection" as the <B>Note ID</B> and your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.  Press <B>OK</B>.<P>

8.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into your Note, then enter analytic process information about the creation of the Quote.  Close the Note when you are finished.<P>

Note that your analytic memos are a place where you can record ideas for future investigation as they come up, but if you do this, you will want to flag them with an identical tag, e.g., ("FOLLOW UP").  This makes it much easier to find them in the future using the <A HREF="WorkingWithJournals.htm">Notes Browser</A>'s Text Search capability.<P>

Lastly, if you want to make a Quote from a single sentence, you don't need to select the text.  Instead, place the Document cursor somewhere in the sentence and create your Quote.  Transana will automatically use the sentence for the Quote in the absence of a manual selection.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create another Standard Quote in a different way.<P>

1. Look for the sentence that states 'Right-click the Collection and choose "Add Quote" from the menu' and place the document cursor in it by clicking somewhere in the sentence.  You do not need to make a selection, as we just want one sentence.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/demodocument2.gif" BORDER=0><P>

2. Right-click the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection and select <B>Add Quote</B> from the popup menu.<P>

3. You now see the <B>Add Quote</B> dialog box, similar to the one shown above (but with different Quote Text.<P>

4. Enter "Create Quote by right-clicking Collection" in the <B>Quote ID</B> field.  <P>

5. Notice that your Quote is automatically assigned the Keyword <B>Tutorial : Document</B>, which is the Keyword that you assigned to the Document from which this Quote was created.  We would like to add a Keyword that identifies this as a Quote, but no such Keyword exists.  Fortunately, we can add new Keywords while in the midst of creating a Quote.<P>

6.  To do this, press the <B>Keyword Management</B> button, which looks like this <IMG SRC="images/KeywordManagementButtonProperties.gif">, on the <B>Add Quote</B> form.  This will open the <B>Keyword Management</B> tool.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagement.gif"><P>

7.  Press the <B>Add Keyword to List</B> button and add a <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword.  Press <B>OK</B> to close the <B>Add Keyword</B> dialog and <B>Close</B> to close the <B>Keyword Management</B> form.  You now have a <B>Quote</B> Keyword in the <B>Tutorial</B> Keyword Group.  Double-click it to add it to the Quote Keywords list.<P>   

8. Click <B>OK.</B><P>

9.  Now right-click your new <B>Create Quote by right-clicking Collection</B> Quote and choose <B>Add Quote Note</B> from the popup menu.  Enter "Create Quote by right-clicking Collection Note" as the <B>Note ID</B> and your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.<P>

10.  Press Ctrl-T to insert a date-time stamp into your Note, then enter analytic process information about the creation of the Quote.  Close the Note when you are finished.<P>

We need several Quotes for demonstration purposes later in the Tutorial, so let's create one more.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions to create another standard Quote in a different way.<P>

1. Look for the sentence that states, "Drag the selected text from the Document and drop it on the target Collection" and select that sentence.<P>

2. Now click on the Document selection, holding down your left mouse button, and drag the selection onto the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection in the Data window.<P>

3. Once again, you see the <B>Add Quote</B> dialog box.  Enter "Create Quote by dragging selection to Collection" in the <B>Quote ID </B>field.  <P>

4. Add a <B>Tutorial : Quote</B> Keyword.  Click <B>OK.</B><P>

5.  Add an appropriate <B>Quote Note</B> to document your analytic process.<P>

You now have a Collection containing three Quotes.  They were all taken from the same Document, but were created in slightly different ways.<P>
