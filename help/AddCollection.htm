To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Collection</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) the &quot;Collections&quot; node in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Collection.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is a &quot;Collection ID&quot; that is unique in the parent object.  &quot;Owner&quot; can be used to indicate the person who created or is in some other way responsible for the Collection, and &quot;Title/Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  The &quot;Default Keyword Group&quot; is the <A HREF="organization.htm">keyword group</A> that will be displayed by default when Clips are added to this Collection.<P>
Collections can also be nested within other Collections.  This allows Transana to represent more complex analytical structures and relationships within the Data Tree Display.  Simply right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) a Collection and select the &quot;Add Nested Collection&quot; option.<P>
