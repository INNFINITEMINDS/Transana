A <A HREF="organization.htm">Transcript</A> in Transana is any document that is associated with a media file.  The main function of a Transcript is to allow researchers to more easily find segments of their media files that they are looking for, and to make the analytic process easier and faster.  There are many different forms Transcripts can take:<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Field Notes</B> can be linked to media files recorded at the same time.<P>
<LI>A <B>Minimal Index</B> records information about where important segments in the media file occur, usually with a very brief description of the contents.<P>
<LI><B>Partial Transcription</B> records information for only those segments of an Episode considered important to an analysis.  These transcripts can contain great detail about some parts of the media file, but also have large segments with no information at all.<P>
<LI><B>Abbreviated or &quot;Gisted&quot; Transcripts</B> seek to capture only the important, necessary, or summary information in a quick, efficient way.<P>
<LI><B>Verbatim Transcription</B> focuses on the verbal level of the media file, capturing the words spoken by participants with the degree of precision in this transcription varying by project.  Sometimes, small amounts of additional behavioral or non-verbal information is added.<P> 
<LI><B>Translation</B> can be useful when some researchers who will be looking at media files do not speak the language (or all of the languages) spoken by the participants.<P>
<LI><B>Visual, Descriptive, Gestural, or other notation</B> systems can be developed to capture non-verbal aspects of video recordings.  Screen captures and still images can be useful in this context.<P>
<LI><B>A view through an analytic lens</B> can be captured through a Transcript.  Information from a particular viewpoint or of a particular layer of the media file can be isolated into a separate transcript.  Often, <A HREF="multitrans.htm">multiple transcripts</A> are analyzed together under this approach.<P>
<LI><B>Conversation, Discourse, and Interaction Analysis</B> have well-defined systems for transcribing with specific foci and details.<P>
<LI><B>Phonetic Transcription</B> can be performed in Transana, including using International Phonetic Alphabet symbols when an IPA font is installed.<P>
</UL><P>

These different styles of transcription fit different analytic approaches, methodologies, and styles.  The more detailed a transcript is, the longer it generally takes to create and edit.<P>  

<A HREF="Transcribing.htm">Transcripts can be created within Transana</A>, or can be imported upon creation.  It is also possible to work with media files in Transana without Transcripts by creating <A HREF="TranscriptlessClips.htm">Transcript-less Clips</A>. <P>

To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Transcript</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) an <A HREF="EpisodeProperties.htm">Episode</A> node in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Transcript.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is a &quot;Transcript ID&quot; that is unique within the Episode.  &quot;Transcriber&quot; can be used to indicate the name of the person who created the Transcript, and &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  You can import Rich-Text Format (*.rtf) documents, Transcripts exported from Transana in XML format (*xml), or plain text (*.txt) documents encoded with Latin-1 encoding using the &quot;RTF/XML/TXT File to Import&quot; field and the associated &quot;Browse&quot; button.<P>

Some Transana users, particularly "form-based" conversation analysts, prefer a highly structured form of transcription where each line is handled independently and paragraph formatting is not used.  The following recommendations make this style of transcription easier in Transana:<P>

First, a fixed-width font should be used.  &quot;Courier New&quot; is the most commonly used font.  <P>
Second, each line should end with the "Enter" or "Return" key being pressed.  That is, each line should be its own paragraph.<P>
Third, line length should be managed manually.  If you are using a 12 point Courier New font, lines should be limited to 64 characters on Windows and 59 characters on OS X.  If you are using a 10 point Courier New font, lines should be limited to 79 characters on Windows and 71 characters on OS X.  This allows the transcript to be printed neatly on US Letter size paper.  Your analytic needs, of course, may differ. <P>
Finally, the &quot;Min Width&quot; field on the Transcript Properties should be set to prevent the transcript window from becoming so small that word wrap will cause formatting problems for the transcript.  A transcript width of about 720 pixels seems about right on Windows, while on OS X, a minimum width of about 520 pixels seems about right.  Of course, your analytic needs and hardware may require different values for your particular situation.<P>
