Once you have selected a database, you see the Transana main screen:<P>

Notice that Transana is made up of five components: the Menu bar, the Media window, the Visualization window, the Document window, and the Data window.<P>

<UL><LI>The Menu bar provides basic Transana program controls.<P>

<LI>The Media window displays and allows for control of video and audio media files.<P>

<LI>The Visualization window displays coding, waveform, or other analytic information about the data you are currently analyzing.<P>

<LI>The Document window provides tools for creating, editing, viewing, and analyzing documents, including Transcripts of media files loaded in the Media window.<P>

<LI>The Data window provides an overview of the structure of your data, along with additional information about the primary data item loaded in the interface. Data on the Database tab is arranged in a tree structure, with your database name at the top. Each item under the database name is called a node. When you right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on a node, Transana opens up a submenu that provides options specific to that node. This tutorial frequently refers to "the database tree," by which we mean the Database tab in the Data window.</UL><P>
