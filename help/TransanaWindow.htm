Once you have selected a database, you see the Transana main screen:<P>

Notice that Transana is made up of five components: the menu bar, the Video window, the Visualization window, the Transcript window, and the Data window.<P>

<UL><LI>The menu bar provides basic Transana program controls.<P>

<LI>The Video window displays the video you are analyzing, or contains the media player for audio analysis.<P>

<LI>The Visualization window displays a waveform or other analytic information about the media file loaded in the Video window.<P>

<LI>The Transcript window provides tools for transcribing the video in the Video window and for viewing that transcript during analysis.<P>

<LI>The Data window provides an overview of the structure of your data. Data is arranged in a tree structure, with your database name at the top. Each item under the database name is called a node. When you right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) on a node, Transana opens up a submenu that provides options specific to that node. This tutorial refers to the information in the Data window as the database tree.</UL><P>
