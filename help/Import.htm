<H1>Import Database</H1><HR>

The &quot;Import Database&quot; function in the Tools menu is intended to import data that is in Transana-XML format.  Such files are created by exporting Data from Transana 2.x using the &quot;<A HREF="export.htm">Export Database</A>&quot; function or by using the Data Exporter to extract data from Transana 1.22 - 1.24.<P>

At this time, you can only import data into a new or empty database.  Combining databases by importing several Transana-XML files into the same database is not supported if there is ANY overlap in the data.<P>

In addition, you may not be able to import data from versions of Transana released after the version you are using.  If you get an error message indicating that you need to upgrade your copy of Transana to be able to import a Transana-XML file, it is most likely because of changes to the Transana database structure and Transana-XML definition required by new features in the program.<P>
