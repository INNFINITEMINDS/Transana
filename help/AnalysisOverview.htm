<H2><I>Analyzing Data - An Overview</I><HR></H2>

Transana is designed to facilitate the qualitative analysis of qualitative data in a wide variety of ways.  There are many different methodologies that fall under the umbrella of qualitative analysis, and many different theoretical orientations that inform those methodologies.  Transana tries to provide a set of tools that will be useful, perhaps in different ways, to researchers with widely varying methodological approaches and theoretical orientations.<P>

Transana's tools have significant overlap and redundancy, so it is up to individual researchers to determine how best to use those tools to accomplish their specific research goals given their theoretical orientation and preferred methodologies.  Researchers are unlikely to need all that Transana offers, and different researchers will combine Transana's tools in different ways, becaue there are many ways to achieve a good understanding of a set of data files.  <P>

<H3>For Media Data, Transcription IS Analysis</H3>

We have already discussed one form of analysis that Transana supports: transcription.  A Transcript is an abstracted representation of recorded events designed by a researcher to make sense out of media data.  Transcripts can take many different forms, and can serve as powerful analytic tools.  All Transcripts are the product of a number of important analytic choices, starting with the basic question of creation.  Should you transcribe or work without transcripts?  What information should you transcribe, with what level of detail?  How frequently do you insert time codes?  What information is <B><I>not</I></B> reflected in the transcript?  All transcripts present a particular view of the data, and that view influences how you see the data.<P>

It is important to acknowledge that transcription is not required, and involves trade-offs.  On the one hand, transcription can be time-consuming and expensive.  It can feel like one is delaying getting to analysis while transcription is being done.  On the other hand, a good transcript can serve as a map to the contents of a media file.  It can be time-consuming and frustrating to look for particular incidents that the researcher did not initially recognize as important but recalls from earlier viewings when a media file has no transcript.  The more in-depth you intend to get with your media files, and the more viewings of these files you anticipate doing, the more important a Transcript can be.<P>  

Transana's linkage between a Transcript and a media file is an important analytic tool.  Reading a Transcript gives you an impression of what was said.  But there is no substitute for hearing what is said and how it is said, seeing the speaker's body language and facial expression, and seeing how others react. This all provides considerable additional information, information which is sometimes crucial to understanding the true meaning of those words and how they should be interpreted.<P>

Researchers can use different Transcripts to encapsulate different analytic lenses or layers through which they view their media files.  Complex analysis can be embedded within Transcripts, and Transcripts can be read analytically.  See <A HREF="multitrans.htm">Working with Multiple Transcripts</A> in the <A HREF="manual.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more on this topic.<P>

<H3>Creating Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots</H3>

In Transana, there are two ways (discussed below) to identify portions of larger source data files as analytically important or meaningful.  These researcher-identified segments of source text files are called <B>Quotes</B> in Transana.  Segments of media files are called <B>Clips</B>.  Still images brought in for analysis are called <B>Snapshots</B>.  Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots are the basic analytic units for most analytic work that is done within Transana.<P>

<H3>Collections and Keywords</H3>

There are two ways that researchers can signify analytic meaning within Transana.  <B>Collections</B> can hold analytic data as represented in Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots.  Items with similar analytic meaning can be grouped into the same Collection, and can be sorted into sub-collections that represent subcategories of the analytic concept the Collection represents.  In this way, Collections can represent theoretical constructs, and Collection membership imparts analytic meaning to analytic data items.  Old-school manual qualitative methods often involved making literal piles of slips of paper, and you can think of Collections as the electronic equivalent.  Items in a Collection can also have an order, which can be important, for example in Narrative analysis.<P>

One common analytic task in Transana is the manipulation of data items within Collections.  A Collection is simply a place where Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots with something in common are gathered.  One way to think about this arrangement is that a Collection represents a theoretical construct, and an item contained in that Collection is essentially a piece of evidence for (or contradicting) that theoretical construct.  (That may not be where you start out in most qualitative analyses, but that's where you want to end up when your analysis is complete!)<P>

Often in qualitative analysis, Collections evolve as the researcher's understanding of the data changes.  A Collection might start out as a broad construct, such as teacher questions.  As the researcher understands that construct better, he or she might create sub-collections to represent different subcategories, or different types of questions that have been observed in the larger grouping.  The researcher would then sort Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots into these different nested collections to indicate the more nuanced understanding emerging from the data.  Dealing with the items that don't fit into this new understanding may lead to further insights.<P>

<B>Keywords</B> are analytic tags that one can assign to Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots to indicate analytic significance.  The act of associating a Keyword with a data item is often referred to as Coding.  An advantage of Keywords is that you can assign multiple keywords to a data item to describe that data item on multiple dimensions, while a Collection usually only indicates the single most important aspect of a data time.<P>

These two systems have different advantages and disadvantages.  Some theoretical approaches favor one or the other.  Many researchers use both, sometimes at different phases of the analytic process or to address different analytic questions or needs.  Supporting both makes Transana more flexible, but also a bit more complicated.  Often, the same results can be achieved either way; rarely is there a "right" or "wrong" choice between the two.<P>       

<H3>Working with Quotes and Clips</H3> 

Because there are two ways to indicate analytic significance, there are two overlapping models for assigning analytic meaning to data for textual and media data.  <P>

<B>Standard Quotes and Clips</B> are data items that a researcher creates, names, and places in a named <B>Collection</B>.  Naming the item is an analytic act where one identifies something important about the item, usually the single most important analytic feature or why one has chosen to make this particular Quote or Clip.  In addition, the Collection in which an item is placed says something about what is analytically significant about that item.  Standard Quotes and Clips may or may not have Keywords assigned to them as coding.  <B><I>Standard Quotes and Clips are Collection-oriented data items.</I></B><P>

<B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> are data items that a researcher creates through the assignment of a <B>Keyword</B>, or code to a portion of text or a segment of a media file.  The researcher does not give the Quick Quote or Clip a name, and Transana automatically places it in the "Quick Quotes and Clips" Collection, expediting the creation process.  The Keyword selected during the creation of the analytic item is what signifies the analytic meaning of that item.  <B><I>Quick Quotes and Clips are Keyword-oriented data items.</I></B><P>

While Standard Quotes and Clips and Quick Quotes and Clips originate in different ways, their use tends to converge later in analysis.  Quick Quotes and Clips can be optionally re-named and moved to named Collections.  Standard Quotes and Clips can be assigned Keywords to code them beyond Collection membership.  If you are unsure which approach is more appropriate for your analytic methods and style, experiment with both to see what appeals and works better for you.<P>

There are a variety of tools in Transana that allow researchers to explore the coding they have applied to their data as they try to make sense of it.  Transana offers a number of graphical and text-based reports that can help the researcher explore their coding and the relationships between codes.  In addition, researchers can use Transana's Search Tool to explore coded data in a variety of different ways.  <P>

<H3>Analytic Memoing</H3>

Remember: at any point while working in Transana and at any stage during the analytic process, researchers can add Notes to Collections, Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots to document analytic thinking,  insights, and understandings.  These analytic memos can be very useful in recording the process by which researchers reach conclusions, an aspect of research which often deserves substantial attention when writing up the results of an analysis.  The Notes Browser is helpful with reviewing notes.<P>

The rest of this Tutorial will focus on the details of these different elements of the qualitative analytic process as implemented in Transana.<P>
