Transana is designed to assist in the analysis of video data in several ways.  As the section above, <A HREF="playingvideo.htm"><I><B>Playing a Transcribed Video</B></I></A>, implies, Transana makes the detailed transcription and meticulous review of selected portions of a video less tedious and difficult than traditional video tape machines.  That is, Transana facilitates a detailed &quot;drill-down&quot; approach to video analysis.<P>
Transana allows you to examine your data by selecting the analytically interesting portions of the video.  These video portions, (called <B>clips</B>), can then be organized into theoretically-related <B>collections</B> to allow for the examination of multiple examples of the same phenomenon.  The process of determining what categories you want to explore and collecting clips that apply is essentially a &quot;deductive&quot; process of data analysis.<P>
Furthermore, Transana allows you to assign analytic <B>keywords</B> to your clips, and it has <B>search</B> capabilities which allow you to combine and recombine your clips into new collections based on keyword search results.  Transana allows the user to take a diverse set of clips and perform data-mining to explore what relationships might exist.  This is essentially an &quot;inductive&quot; process of data analysis.<P>
Finally, Transana can be used to explore video for the purposes of video case design.  If you want to take a large amount of video and boil it down to a coherent case, Transana can facilitate the process of determining what parts of the video are of interest to illustrate a particular point.  While Transana is not video editing software, it can be quite useful in figuring out what to include and exclude, as well as in exploring the order in which clips should be shown, when building a video case.  Thus, Transana works as an analysis tool for case development as well.<P>
In this section of the tutorial, you concentrate on building a collection of clips that explore the development of the understanding of symmetry among the second-graders in the Demo video.<P>
