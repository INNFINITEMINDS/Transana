<H2><I>Analyzing a Video - An Overview</I><HR></H2>

Transana is designed to facilitate the qualitative analysis of video and audio data in a wide variety of ways.  There are many different methodologies that fall under the umbrella of qualitative analysis, and many different theoretical orientations that inform those methodologies.  Transana tries to provide a set of tools that will be useful, perhaps in different ways, to researchers with widely varying methodological approaches and theoretical orientations.<P>

Transana's tools have significant overlap and redundancy and it is up to individual researchers to determine how best to use those tools to accomplish their research goals given their theoretical orientation and preferred methodologies.  Few researchers need all that Transana offers, and different researchers will combine Transana's tools in different ways.  There are many different ways one can accomplish the task of achieving a good understanding of a set of media files.  <P>

<H3>Transcription IS Analysis</H3>

We've already talked extensively in this Tutorial about one form of analysis that Transana supports, transcription.  A transcript is an abstracted representation of recorded events designed to help a researcher make sense out of the data.  Transcripts can take many different forms, and can serve as powerful analytic tools.  All transcripts are the product of a number of important analytic choices;  what information should you transcribe, with what level of detail?  How frequently do you insert time codes?  What information is <B><I>not</I></B> reflected in the transcript?  All transcripts present a particular view of the data, and that view can influence how one sees the data.<P>

Transana's linkage between the transcript and the media file is an important analytic tool.  Reading a transcript gives you an impression of what was said.  Hearing what is said and how it is said, seeing the speaker's body language and facial expression, and seeing how others react provide considerable additional information, information which is sometimes crucial about the true meaning of those words and how they should be interpreted.<P>

Researchers can use different transcripts to encapsulate different analytic lenses or layers through which they view their media files.  Complex analysis can be embedded within transcripts, and transcripts can be read analytically.  See <A HREF="multitrans.htm">Working with Multiple Transcripts</A> in the <A HREF="mainpage.htm">Transana Manual</A> for more on this topic.<P>

<H3>Creating Clips</H3>

In Transana, there are a number of ways that you can identify smaller portions of your larger original media files as being analytically important or meaningful.  These small segments of analytic media are called <B>Clips</B> in Transana, and they are the basic analytic unit for most analytic work that is done with the program.  There are two overlapping models for creating clips.<P>

<B>Standard clips</B> are clips that a researcher creates, names , and places in a named <B>collection</B>.  Naming a clip is an analytic act where one identifies something important about the clip.  In addition, the collection a clip is placed in says something about what is analytically important about the clip.  Standard clips may or may not have keywords assigned to them.  <B><I>Standard clips are collection-oriented clips.</I></B><P>

<B>Quick clips</B> are clips that a researcher creates through the assignment of a <B>keyword</B>, or code.  The researcher does not give the quick clip a name, and Transana automatically places it in the "Quick Clips" collection.  The keyword selected during the creation of the quick clip is what signifies the analytic meaning of the portion of the media file selected.  <B><I>Quick clips are keyword-oriented clips.</I></B><P>

While standard clips and quick clips originate in different ways, their use tends to converge later in analysis.  Quick clips can be named and moved to collections.  Standard clips can be assigned keywords.  If you are not sure which type of clip is appropriate for your analytic approach, experiment with both.  The two types of clips are more similar than different.<P>

<H3>Working with Clips</H3>

One common analytic task in Transana is the manipulation of clips within collections.  A collection is simply a place where clips with something in common are gathered.  One way to think about this arrangement is that a collection represents a theoretical construct, and a clip contained in that collection is essentially a piece of evidence for (or contradicting) that theoretical construct.  (That may not be where you start out in most qualitative analyses, but that's where you want to end up when your analysis is complete!)<P>

Often in qualitative analysis, collections evolve as the researcher's understanding of the data changes.  A collection might start out as a broad construct, such as teacher questions.  As the researcher understands that construct better, he or she might created sub-collections to represent different subcategories, different types of questions that have been observed in the larger grouping.  The researcher would then sort different clips into these different nested collections to indicate the more nuanced understanding which has emerged from the data.  Dealing with the clips that don't fit into this new understanding may lead to further insights.<P>

There are a variety of tools in Transana that allow researchers to explore the coding they have applied to their clips as they try to make sense of their data.  Transana offers a number of graphical and text-based reports that can help the researcher explore their coding and the relationships between codes.  In addition, researchers can use Transana's search tool to explore coded clips in a variety of different ways.  <P>

<H3>Analytic Memoing</H3>

Throughout the analytic process, researchers can add notes to collections and clips that describe their analytic thinking,  insights, and understandings.  These analytic memos can be very useful in recording the process by which researchers reach the conclusions they do, a process which often deserves substantial attention when writing up the results of an analysis.  The Notes Browser is helpful with reviewing notes.<P>

The rest of this Tutorial will focus on the details of these different elements of the qualitative analytic process as implemented in Transana.<P>
