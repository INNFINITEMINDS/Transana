<H2><I>Creating a Series</I><HR></H2>

Before you can enter a media file in Transana, you must create a series in which to place the media file.  <B>A series is simply a group of related media files</B>.  In small studies, there may only be one series named for the study.  However, having such catetories can be very important for more complex studies with lots of media files that fall into different groupings.  <P>

As a general rule, the series name should reflect the most salient thing about the media files that will be grouped together.  In this phase of the study, we might be looking at how different teachers implement the same curriculum, so we will name our series after the curriculum being used.  Later, we might want to look at something else, and we can always rename our series records and reorganize our episode records within our series records if we want to.  How we organize our raw media files (so we can find them later) is independent of how we will organize our analytic data later in the analytic process.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions (Macintosh single-button mouse users should Control-click instead of right-click):<P>

1. To create a series, right-click the Series node in the database tree and choose <B>Add Series</B> from the pop-up menu.  You see the following dialog box:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/addseries.gif"  ALT="addseries"   BORDER=0><P>

2. Enter <B>Geometry by Design</B> as the Series ID.  Enter your name or initials as the Owner, and select <B>Tutorial</B> as the Default Keyword Group in the list.  Click OK to close the dialog box and save the record to the database.  Your Series should now appear in the database tree.<P>

3. We have just made our first important analytic decision by choosing what to call our series.  Let's create an analytic memo to document this analytic step.  To do this, right-click the <B>Geometry by Design</B> series and choose <B>Add Series Note</B>.<P>

4. The function of this analytic memo is to document the reasoning behind the creation of our first series.  We can reflect that in our Note ID.  Name the note <B>Geometry by Design Series Purpose</B> and put your initials under <B>Note Taker</B>.  Click OK.<P>

5. Start your analytic memo by pressing Ctrl-T to get a date and time stamp to record when you wrote this particular analytic memo.  Then write a brief explanation of the thinking behind the creation of the <B>Geometry by Design</B> series.<P>

Being very thorough with your analytic memo writing can be extremely important when it comes to writing up your analysis.  It is through writing and modifying analytic memos that a qualitative researcher documents the analytic process in Transana.  It is a good practice to date and time stamp all entries in each note, and to avoid deleting content from notes.  While your thinking and understanding of your data will change as you work through your analysis, sometimes it is important to be able to recreate early ideas that you reject and the thought process that led to new ideas during the writing phases of your research.  Analytic memos, including those that indicate what ideas you rejected, can be crucial in this process.<P>

6.  Close your note when you are finished.  Transana automatically saves the changes to your note when you close the note editor.<P>

<FONT COLOR="red">Advanced topic:</FONT>  In most cases, Transana doesn't care how you organize your data.  However, if you want to look for changes in coding patterns over time, (i.e. if you want to do <B><I>longitudinal qualitative analysis</I></B>,) all media files to be compared must be implemented as episodes in the same series.  See <A HREF="reports.htm">Reports</A> later in the Tutorial for more information on this topic.<P>
