<H1>Other Transana Functions</H1><HR>

<H2>Adjust Indices</H2><P>
Adjust Indices allows you to alter all <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in a Transcript by a constant amount.  This is helpful when you want to use an existing transcript for a new video file that may not start at precisely the same millisecond.  The Adjust Indices option is available in the Transcript Menu.<P>

<H2>Auto-Arrange</H2><P>
The Auto-Arrange option in the Options menu determines whether user changes in the size of one Transana window cause automatic changes in the size or position of the other Transana windows.  If you have a dual-monitor setup, it can be very nice to turn Auto-Arrange off, move the video to your second monitor, and increase the size of the Data window.<P>

<H2>Auto Word-Tracking</H2><P>
The Auto Word-Tracking option is located in the Options menu. When it is checked, the transcript will be highlighted as the video plays. You must have <A HREF="timecodes.htm">time codes</A> in your transcript for this to work, and the transcript must not be in &quot;Edit&quot; mode.<P>

<H2>Change/Create Database</H2><P>
Transana supports the creation and use of multiple, separate databases.  To change from one database to another, select &quot;Change Database&quot; from the File Menu.  If you want to create a new database, simply type in the name of a database that does not exist, and Transana will prompt you about creating it.<P>

<H2>Locate Clip in Episode</H2><P>
There are times when it is desirable to be able to move from a Clip back to the Episode it was created from.  For example, you may want to look at what occurs immediately before or after a clip, or you may want to create a similar clip with different start or end points.  To move from a Clip back to the original Episode, right-click the Clip on the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and select &quot;Locate Clip in Episode.&quot;  Please note that if the time codes associated with a clip are deleted in the originating Transcript, this function may not work properly.<P>

<H2>Play all Clips in a Collection</H2><P>
There are some circumstances when it is helpful to be able to review all clips in a collection in sequence.  To do this, right-click a collection and select the &quot;Play All Clips&quot; option.  Clips will be played in the order they are displayed in the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data Window</A>.  To change the order in which clips are played, simply cut-and-paste (or drag-and-drop) the clips within the collection  so that they are displayed in the desired order.  Play All Clips will play clips from nested collections automatically, but you can stop this by pressing the "Cancel" button.<P>

<H2>Presentation Mode</H2><P>
Presentation Mode, selected in the Options Menu, offers four choices that affect the way Transana presents video during playback.  &quot;All Windows,&quot; the default setting, shows all Transana windows during video playback.  &quot;Video Only&quot; displays the video window full screen when the video is playing.  &quot;Video and Transcript Only&quot; displays the video in the top 65% of the screen and displays the transcript, with scrolling highlight if Auto Word-tracking is enabled, in the bottom 35% of the screen.  &quot;Audio and Transcript Only&quot; hides the video during playback, showing the transcript full screen and playing only the audio portion of the media file.<P>

<H2>Print a Transcript</H2><P>
The option allowing you to print the currently-loaded transcript is located in the Transcript Menu as well as the more traditional location of the File menu.<P>

<H2>Video Size</H2><P>
In the Options menu, the Video Size sub-menu allows you to change the size of the Video window and have all other windows compensate automatically.<P>
