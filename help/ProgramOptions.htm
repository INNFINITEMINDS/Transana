<H1>Program Settings</H1><HR>

To get to Transana's Program Setting, on Windows, go to the &quot;Options&quot; menu and select &quot;Program Settings&quot;.  On OS X, follow the traditional OS X path of starting with the &quot;Transana&quot; menu and choosing &quot;Preferences&quot;.

There are several tabs under Program Settings:<P>

The <B>Directories Tab</B> allows you to specify the folders on your system where Transana should store different types of program data. <P>

The <B>Media Library Directory</B> allows a user to define a common starting point for all media files to be analyzed with Transana.  This is useful for people who need to copy data between different computers, such as a desktop and a laptop, for example.  The desktop may specify a network location where all video is stored, while the laptop may need to point to a local hard drive where only a subset of the video is available because of storage limitations.  In such a situation, the Video Root Directory on Desktop might be N:\ProjectName\Video, while on the laptop it might be C:\Video.  As long as video files are arranged in the same directory hierarchy from the Media Library Directories, Transana is able to find the appropriate video on all systems that use the Media Library Directory properly.  This setting is vital for users of Transana's multi-user version in cross-platform environments, where different computers may refer to the same video location in different ways.  <P>

The <B>Waveform Directory</B> tells Transana where to look for and store the extracted audio files it creates as part of drawing waveform diagrams.  If there are multiple computers sharing the same video files, sharing waveforms can reduce the overall time spent on audio extraction, as only the first user needs to complete this process.  You must have "write" privileges to the waveform directory.<P>

The <B>Database Directory</B> setting allows you to specify the location of your database files.  You should store your database somewhere where it will be backed up regularly.  When you change this setting, you must quit and restart Transana before the change will take effect.  (This setting is not available on the multi-user version of Transana, where a database server is selected during program startup.)<P>

The <B>Transcriber Settings Tab</B> allows you to control settings that are used during transcription.<P>

Within the <A HREF="documentwindow.htm">Document Window</A>, the Ctrl-S key combination can be used to start and stop media playback while you are transcribing a media file.  The media is automatically rewound a small amount before it is played to ease the transcription process.  The <B>Transcription Setback</B> setting allows you to specify the amount of rewind, from 0 to 5 seconds, used in this situation.  <P>

On Windows, Transana can use several different media player "back ends" to play media files of different formats.  Transana automatically chooses the QuickTime Player for some media formats (such as *.mov, *.mp4, and *.m4v files), and uses the Windows Media Player back end for most of other formats.  However, Transana may use either the Windows Media Player back end or the DirectShow back end within Windows Media Player.  These different back ends may support different formats in different ways, having implications for whether the media can be displayed, and whether playback speed can be altered.  This relationship is complicated, with different formats sometimes acting differently on different Windows versions with different back ends.  If your media file isn't behaving as you'd like it to, try the other <B>Media Player Selection</B> setting and see if anything changes.  OS X users also do not have the Media Player Selection option, as the QuickTime Player is the only media player option on OS X in Transana.<P>

<B>Media Playback Speed</B> can be changed for some media formats with the second slider, and can range from 1/10<SUP>th</SUP> normal speed to twice normal speed, (unless this option is over-ridden by the Media Player Selection or the media file format being used.)  This allows you to adjust the playback speed to match your typing abilities, and allows more careful analysis of quick events in your media files, such as rapid animal behaviors.  Not all media files respond to this setting.<P>

You can set the <B>default font</B> and <B>font size</B> for new transcripts on this tab.  (These two settings have no effect on existing transcripts.)  Transana's special symbols, such as the time code character and the Jeffersonian Notation special symbols in the Transcript Toolbar, can be made larger than surrounding text to make them more easily visible by setting the <B>Special Symbol Font</B> and <B>Special Symbol Font Size</B>.<P>

Transana-MU, the multi-user version, has an additional tab under Program Settings, the <B>MU Message Server Tab</B>.  If you are not using the multi-user version of Transana, you will not see this tab.<P>

Did you know that when you do something that changes the Database tab in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data Window</A>, all other users sharing the same database see your change instantly and automatically?  This is possible because of the Transana-MU Message Server.  <P>

The MU Message Server Tab within Program Settings allows you to specify the name of the server where your copy of the Transana Message Server is running, and the port number it is running on.  There is no default server name (we have no idea what server yours will be installed on), but the default port number is 17595.  <I><B>Please note that all Transana-MU instances working with the same data set need to connect to the same Transana-MU Message Server.</B></I>  If you need to change the SSL information for your Message Server, you must do so during <A HREF="startingtransana.htm">program startup</A>.<P>
