<H1>Data Window<HR ></H1><P>

Transana's Data Window is made up of as many as four tabs, depending upon what is currently loaded in Transana.<P>

The <B>Database tab</B> is always available, and displays the organizational structure of all Transana data in a hierarchical tree format.  The <B>Episode Clips tab</B> and the <B>Selection Clips tab</B> are only available when an Episode is loaded, and they display information about what Clips have been created from the loaded Episode.  The <B>Keywords tab</B> is available when an Episode or a Clip is loaded in Transana, and displays information about the keywords that have been applied to the loaded Episode or Clip.<P>

The <B>Database tab</B> helps you organize and manipulate your data.   It is arranged in a tree structure, with the following possible nodes:<P>

See <A HREF="organization.htm">Organizational Structure</A> for more information on what these nodes mean.<P>

Most elements in the database tab in the data window can be manipulated through their right-click menus, which vary depending on the type of object you select.  (Macintosh users with single-button mice will find that holding down the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key on the keyboard while clicking on an item in the data tree emulates a right-click.)  Typically, each element also has a default behavior which can be accessed by double-clicking the element.  For Transcripts and Clips, this default behavior is to load and display the appropriate element in Transana, while for the remaining items the default is to expand the node or add an appropriate sub-object.<P>

These right-click menus often include &quot;Cut,&quot; &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; options for copying and moving data elements and manipulating them in other ways.  You can move Episodes between Series, copy or move Clips between Collections, add Keywords to Episodes and Clips, and copy or move Keywords between groups.  Some cut, copy, and paste operations affect multiple objects.  If you copy a Collection and paste it on another collection, all the Clips in the first Collection will be copied to the second.  If you copy a Keyword onto a Collection, that Keyword will be applied to all the Clips in the Collection.<P>

All of the actions that can be done with cut, copy, and paste can also be accomplished with drag and drop.  Dragging a node in the database tree onto another node is equivalent to cutting and pasting, while if you hold down the Ctrl key on Windows or the Alt key on the Mac during the drop, that is the equivalent of copy and paste.<P>

The <B>Episode Clips tab</B> in the Data Window displays all Clips that have been created from the loaded Episode in order of the Clip start time.  You can load a Clip by double-clicking on it in this list.<P>

The <B>Selection Clips tab</B> displays all Clips that have been created from the current location in the Episode's Transcript and media file.  This list changes as the Episode plays, whenever you place the cursor in the Transcript, or whenever you select a location in the visualization window.  Please note that when a segment of the transcript is selected, only the clips related to the starting point of that selection are displayed until the video is played.  You can load a Clip by double-clicking on it in this list.<P>

The <B>Keywords tab</B> in the Data Window displays information about the keywords that have been assigned to the currently-loaded Episode or Clip.  The keyword list can be edited by right-clicking within the list and selecting &quot;Edit&quot; from the popup menu, and keywords can be deleted by right-clicking them and selecting &quot;Delete.&quot;<P>
