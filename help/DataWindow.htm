<H1>Data Window<HR ></H1><P>

Transana's Data Window shows data in Transana's database and information about that data.  It is made up of as many as four tabs, depending upon what is currently loaded in Transana.<P>

<UL><LI>The <B>Database tab</B> is always available, and displays the organizational structure of all Transana data in a hierarchical tree format.<P>    

<LI>The <B>Document Items tab</B> is only available when a Document is loaded in Transana's main interface and displays information about what Quotes have been created from the loaded Document.<P>     

<LI>The <B>Episode Items tab</B> is only available when an Episode is loaded in Transana's main interface and displays information about what Clips have been created from the loaded Episode and what Snapshots have been associated with it.<P>   

<LI>The <B>Selected Items tab</B>, available when a Document or an Episode is loaded, shows what Quotes, Clips, or Snapshots are associated with the currently selected position of the loaded Document or Episode.<P>   

<LI>The <B>Keywords tab</B> is available when a Document, an Episode, a Quote, or a Clip is loaded in Transana's main interface and displays information about the keywords that have been applied to the loaded Document, Episode, Quote, or Clip.</UL><P>

The <B>Database tab</B> helps you organize and manipulate your data.   It is arranged in a tree structure, with the following possible nodes:<P>

<IMG SRC="images/organization.gif"><P>

See <A HREF="organization.htm">Organizational Structure</A> for more information on what these nodes mean.<P>

Most elements in the database tab in the data window can be manipulated through their right-click menus, which vary depending on the type of object you select.  (Macintosh users with single-button mice will find that holding down the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key on the keyboard while clicking on an item in the data tree emulates a right-click.)<P>  

Typically, each element also has a default behavior which can be accessed by double-clicking the element.  For Documents, Transcripts, Quotes, Clips, Snapshote, and Notes, this default behavior is to load and display the appropriate element in Transana.  For Collections, the default behavior is to create a new Quote or Clip.  For Keywords, the default behavior is to create Quick Quotes or Quick Clips.  Ror the remaining items the default is to expand the node.<P>

The right-click menus often include &quot;Cut,&quot; &quot;Copy&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; options for copying and moving data elements and manipulating them in other ways.  You can move Documents and Episodes between Libraries, copy or move Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots between Collections, apply Keywords to Documents, Episodes, Quotes, Clips, and Snapshots, and copy or move Keywords between Keyword Groups.  Some cut, copy, and paste operations affect multiple objects.  If you copy a Keyword onto a Collection, that Keyword will be applied to all the Quotes, Clips and Snapshots in the Collection, but this will not propagate to the contents of nested Collections.  You can, however, multi-select all nested Collections and paste the Keyword on them all at once.<P>

All of the actions that can be done with cut, copy, and paste can also be accomplished with drag and drop.  Dragging a node in the database tree onto another node is equivalent to cutting and pasting, while if you hold down the Ctrl key on Windows or the Alt or Cmd key on the Mac during the drop, that is the equivalent of copy and paste.<P>

The <B>Document Items tab</B> in the Data Window displays all Quotes that have been created from the loaded Document in order of starting character position.  You can load a Quote by double-clicking on the Item ID in this list, or you can go the the Quote's context by double-clicking on the Position in the list.<P>

The <B>Episode Items tab</B> in the Data Window displays all Clips that have been created from the loaded Episode in order of the Clip start time as well as all Snapshots associated with that Episode.  You can load a Clip or Shapshot by double-clicking on the Item ID in this list, or you can go the the Clip's context by double-clicking on the Time in the list.<P>

The <B>Selection Clips tab</B> displays the same information as the Document Items tab or Episode Items tab, but limited to the current position within the Document or Episode.  This list changes as the Document or Transcript cursor position changes, as the Episode plays, or whenever you select a new location in the visualization window.  Please note that when a segment of the transcript is selected, only the clips related to the starting point of that selection are displayed until the video is played.  You can load a Quote, Clip or Snapshot by double-clicking on the Item ID in this list, or can go to the position by clicking on the Position or Time for the item.<P>

The <B>Keywords tab</B> in the Data Window displays information about the keywords that have been assigned to the currently-loaded Document, Episode, Quote, or Clip.  The keyword list can be edited by right-clicking within the list and selecting &quot;Edit&quot; from the popup menu, and keywords can be deleted by right-clicking them and selecting &quot;Delete.&quot;<P>
