The Batch Waveform Generator utility allows you to create waveforms of many files based on a single selection process.  When you select this option from the Tools Menu, you are prompted to select the video and audio files you want it to make waveforms for, either by the file or by the directory. Select as many media files as you want.  If you have a malformed audio extraction file that needs to be replaced, be sure to check the "Overwrite existing wave files?" option.  Then click on the &quot;OK&quot; button.  While you cannot use Transana while the Batch Waveform Generator is running, you can use your computer for other programs.<P>
