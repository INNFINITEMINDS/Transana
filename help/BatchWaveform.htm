The Batch Waveform Generator utility allows you to create waveforms of many files based on a single selection process.  When you select this option from the Tools Menu, you are prompted to select the video and audio files you want it to make waveforms for, one at a time. Select as many as you want.  Then click on the &quot;OK&quot; button.  While you cannot use Transana while the Batch Waveform Generator is running, you can use your computer for other programs.<P>
