Transana provides several different methods for playing a clip.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>To view a Clip, double-click it in the database tree (in the data window), then click Play in the video window.  (If you do not see your clip, you may need to open your collection by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; symbol to the left of the collection name.)  Go ahead and play the clip you just created. When you have finished, you can return to the entire transcript, by double clicking the name of the transcript (Sample Transcript) in the database tree.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Now try this method. With an Episode loaded, click on the <B>Episode Clips</B> tab in the Data window.  (If this tab is not displayed, double-click Sample Transcript in the database tree to load this episode.)  The Episode Clips tab shows all clips created from the current episode in order of start time.  To view the clip you created (called Introduction) double-click it in this list.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Sometimes you might want to see the context of the clip. For example, you may want to see what happened right before or right after your clip.  To move from a clip back to the episode from which it was created, right-click the clip in the Data window's Database tab and select <B>Locate Clip in Episode</B> from the popup menu.  Try that now for the Introduction Clip in the Symmetry Collection.  Notice that the episode video is automatically positioned at the start of the clip, and that the first part of the transcript related to the clip is highlighted.<P>
