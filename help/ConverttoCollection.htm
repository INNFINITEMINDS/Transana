<H2><I>Converting Search Results to Collections</I><HR></H2>

Transana lets you preserve the results of a search as a collection.  When you discover something brilliant using the Search in Transana, one way to save that analytic insight is through creating a collection full of the clips that support the new insight.<P>

In this activity you convert the results of the <B>Symmetry</B> quick search into a collection called <B>Symmetry Search Results</B>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1. Right-click the search name <B>Tutorial : Symmetry</B>. It's shown in the database tree with a magnifying glass icon next to it. Don't confuse it with the collection named Symmetry that is part of the result set for this search; this entry appears with a file cabinet icon next to it. Select <B>Convert to Collection</B> from the pop-up menu.<P>

2. Transana opens the <B>Collection Properties</B> dialog box. Replace <B>Tutorial : Symmetry</B> with <B>Symmetry Search Results </B>in the field labeled <B>Collection ID. </B>Add your initials to the field labeled <B>Owner</B> and select <B>Tutorial</B> as the <B>Default Keyword Group</B>.  Click <B>OK</B> when you have finished.<P>

Notice that the Search Result disappears when the conversion is complete. Also note that Transana does not convert episodes in this process, because episodes cannot be included in collections even though they can be included in Search Results.  <P>

3.  Finally, create a collection note to document the process by which you reached your brilliant analytic insight.  <P>
