Transana lets you preserve the results of a search as a Collection.  When you discover something brilliant using the Search in Transana, one way to save that analytic insight is through creating a Collection full of the data items that support the new insight.<P>

In this activity you convert the results of the <B>Clip adn Quick Creation Method</B> search into a Collection called <B>Quick Clip Search Results</B>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1. Right-click the search result named <B>Clip and Quick Creation Method</B>. It's shown in the database tree with a magnifying glass icon next to it. Select <B>Convert to Collection</B> from the pop-up menu.<P>

2. Transana opens the <B>Collection Properties</B> dialog box. Replace <B>Clip and Quick Creation Method</B> with <B>Quick Clip Search Results </B>in the field labeled <B>Collection ID. </B>Add your initials to the field labeled <B>Owner</B> and select <B>Tutorial</B> as the <B>Default Keyword Group</B>.  Click <B>OK</B> when you have finished.<P>

Notice that the Search Result disappears when the conversion is complete. Also note that Transana will not convert Documents or Episodes if they are included in the search, because Documents and Episodes cannot be included in Collections even though they can be included in Search Results.  <P>

3.  Finally, create a Collection Note to document the process by which you reached your brilliant analytic insight.  <P>
