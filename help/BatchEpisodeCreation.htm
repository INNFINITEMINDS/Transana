Batch Episode Creation allows you to create many episodes in Transana with a single action.<P>

To begin the Batch Episode Creation process, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) a Series object in the Datatbase Tree in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data Window</A> and choose "Batch Episode Creation".  The Batch Episode Creation dialog will appear.<P>

The "Select Files" button allows you to select one or more files from a directory to add to the Selected Files list for processing.  The "Select Directory" button allows you to select a directory, thereby adding all media files from that directory and all subdirectories to the Selected Files list for processing.  If this adds more files to the list than you intend, you can make multiple selections within the Selected Files list and remove them using the "Remove Selected File(s)" button.<P>

When you press "OK" from this dialog, Transana will create an Episode in the selected Series for each of the media files selected.  The Episode will be named after the media file.  A Transcript will be created for each episode, also named after the media file.  If there is a rich text format document (*.rtf) or a plain text document (*.txt) in the same directory and with the same root filename as the media file, this file will be imported into the Transcript.  That is, if you select "MyVideo.mpg" and Transana finds a file in the same directory called "MyVideo.rtf" or "MyVideo.txt", Transana will assume that this file is an existing transcript that should be imported into the MyVideo Transcript for the MyVideo Episode.<P>
