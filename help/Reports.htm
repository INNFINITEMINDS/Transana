<H2><I>Transana's Reports<HR ></I></H2>

<P>Transana provides a variety of reports that allow you to explore the clips you've created and the coding you've applied to your media files using keywords.</P>

<H3>Series-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Series Keyword Usage Report</B> produces a list of keywords for all episodes in the selected series. This allows you to review the default keywords you have assigned to all episodes in a series.  To generate a Series Keyword Usage Report, right-click the name of a series in the database tree and choose <B>Keyword Usage Report</B> from the pop-up menu. When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.</P>

<P>The <B>Series Keyword Sequence Map</B> displays normalized keyword maps (see below) for multiple episodes in a series.  This type of map is useful for comparing patterns such as the density, co-occurrence, and proximity of keywording.  The <B>Series Keyword Bar Graph</B> and the <B>Series Keyword Percentage Graph</B> are variations on the same display.  See <A HREF="seriesmap.htm">Series Keyword Graphs</A> in the Transana Manual for more information.  To view any of these reports, right-click a Series and select the map or graph you desire.</P>

<H3>Episode-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Episode Keyword Usage Report</B> produces a list of keywords for all clips created from the selected episode. To generate a Episode Keyword Usage Report, right-click the name of an episode in the database tree and choose <B>Keyword Usage Report</B> from the pop-up menu. When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Collection Keyword Usage Report.</P>

<P>The <B>Keyword Map</B>, available for all episodes, provides a graphical representation of how keywords have been applied to clips made from that episode.  Each color represents a different clip, so multiple bands of the same color at the same point in the episode's time line indicate a single clip with multiple keywords.  It is important to note that the presence of the same keyword at the same location in different clips is not represented, and that the clip that is processed last in assembling this report will be the only one shown, when there is an overlap. To generate a Keyword Map, right-click on the name of an episode in the database tree and choose <B>Keyword Map</B> from the pop-up menu. When you have finished looking at the map, click the close button. </P>

<P>The <B>Episode Clip Data Export</B> function allows you to export information about clips created an episode, along with their coding, to a tab-delimited text file.  This data file can be imported into other software, such as SPSS and Excel, to allow for additional analysis.</P>

<H3>Collection-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Collection Summary Report</B> creates a printer-ready report about all clips in a collection including clip ID, media file name, clip start and stop times and duration, and the clip transcript.  This information can be very useful in studying your clips, and in editing video after using Transana during case development. To generate a Collection Summary Report, right-click the name of a collection in the database tree and choose <B>Collection Summary Report</B> from the pop-up menu. When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/collectionsummaryreport.gif"  ALT="collectionsummaryreport"   BORDER=0></P>

<P>The <B>Collection Keyword Usage Report</B> produces a list of keywords for all clips in a collection, including a summary that indicates the number of times each keyword appears within the collection.  To generate a Collection Keyword Usage Report, right-click the name of a collection in the database tree and choose <B>Keyword Usage Report</B> from the pop-up menu. When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Episode Keyword Usage Report.</P>

<P>The <B>Collection Clip Data Export</B> function allows you to export information about clips gathered into a collection, along with their coding, to a tab-delimited text file.  This data file can be imported into other software, such as SPSS and Excel, to allow for additional analysis.</P>
