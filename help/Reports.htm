<H2><I>Transana's Reports<HR ></I></H2>

<P>Transana provides a variety of reports that allow you to explore the clips you've created and the coding you've applied to your media files using keywords.</P>

<H3>Series-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Series Report</B> produces a list of episode keywords for all episodes in the selected series. This allows you to review the default keywords you have assigned to all episodes in a series.  To generate a Series Report, right-click the name of a series in the database tree and choose <B>Series Report</B> from the pop-up menu. This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what episodes and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.</P>

<P>The <B>Series Keyword Sequence Map</B> displays normalized keyword maps (see below) for multiple episodes in a series.  This type of map is useful for comparing patterns such as the density, co-occurrence, and proximity of keywording.  The <B>Series Keyword Bar Graph</B> and the <B>Series Keyword Percentage Graph</B> are variations on the same display.  See <A HREF="seriesmap.htm">Series Keyword Graphs</A> in the Transana Manual for more information.  To view any of these reports, right-click a series and select the map or graph you desire.  These reports can be customized in a variety of ways, saved as JPEG images, and printed.</P>

<P>The <B>Series Clip Data Export</B> function allows you to export information about clips created from all episodes in a series, along with their coding, to a tab-delimited text file.  This data file can be imported into other software, such as SPSS and Excel, to allow for additional analysis.</P>

<H3>Episode-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Episode Report</B> produces a list of all clips created from the selected episode, and can optionally include clip transcripts, clip keywords, and clip comments. To generate an Episode Report, right-click the name of an episode in the database tree and choose <B>Episode Report</B> from the pop-up menu. This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what data elements should be shown, and what clips and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Collection Report.</P>

<P>The <B>Keyword Map</B>, available for all episodes, provides a graphical representation of how keywords have been applied to clips made from that episode.  Each color represents a different clip, so multiple bands of the same color at the same point in the episode's time line indicate a single clip with multiple keywords.  It is important to note that the presence of the same keyword at the same location in different clips is not represented, and that the clip that is processed last in assembling this report will be the only one shown, when there is an overlap. To generate a Keyword Map, right-click on the name of an episode in the database tree and choose <B>Keyword Map</B> from the pop-up menu. This map can be customized in a variety of ways, saved in JPEG format, and printed.  In addition, if you click a band in the report, the associated clip will be loaded in Transana.  When you have finished looking at the map, click the <B>close</B> button. </P>

<P>The <B>Episode Clip Data Export</B> function allows you to export information about clips created from an episode, along with their coding, to a tab-delimited text file.  This data file can be imported into other software, such as SPSS and Excel, to allow for additional analysis.</P>

<H3>Collection-based Reports</H3>

<P>The <B>Collection Report</B> produces a list of all clips gathered together in the specified collection, and can optionally include clip transcripts, clip keywords, and clip comments. To generate a Collection Report, right-click the name of a collection in the database tree and choose <B>Collection Report</B> from the pop-up menu. Selecting <B>Collection Report</B> from the Collections Root node will give you a report for all clips in all collections.  This report can be customized in a variety of ways.  The <A HREF="FilterDialog.htm">Filter Dialog</A> allows you to specify what data elements should be shown, and what clips and keywords should be included or excluded in the report.  By default, clips in nested collections are included in the report, though this can be changed through the filter dialog.  You can edit this report directly, save it as a Rich Text format document, and print it.  When you have finished looking at the report, click <B>Close</B> to exit.  Please note that this is structurally similar but analytically very different from the Episode Report.</P>

<P>The <B>Collection Clip Data Export</B> function allows you to export information about clips gathered into a collection, along with their coding, to a tab-delimited text file.  Selecting <B>Clip Data Export</B> from the Collections Root node will give you this information for all clips in all collections.  This data file can be imported into other software, such as SPSS and Excel, to allow for additional analysis.</P>
