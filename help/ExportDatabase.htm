<H1>Export Data</H1><HR>

To export data from a Transana database for transfer to another computer, go to the Tools menu and select &quot;Export Data.&quot;  You can choose to export your entire database or just your Codebook made up of all of your Keywords in Keyword Groups.  Browse to a directory and enter the name you want to give to the data file.  This file will have a &quot;.tra&quot; file extension to indicate that it is in Transana-XML format.<P>

To transfer this data to another computer, you will need to copy the Transana-XML file created by the Export Database routine, as well as all related media files that the new computer does not already have access to, to the new computer.  You will then need to run the &quot;<A HREF="importdatabase.htm">Import Data</A>&quot; routine on the new computer.<P>

The Transana-XML file produced by this routine is intended only for use by Transana.  It is generally not a good idea to try to edit this file unless you know exactly what you are doing.  <P>
