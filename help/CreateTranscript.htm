A transcript of a video is a valuable analysis tool. Transcripts can show not only the words spoken in the video, but can contain codes that indicate information about how the words were spoken and what behavior or gestures accompany the words. (With the proper transcribing conventions, transcripts of all kinds of non-verbal activity can be created.)  And once a video has been transcribed, you can insert time codes that link the spoken words and actions in the video to the transcription of the dialogue, so that you can examine them in tandem. <P>
Whenever you add an Episode, Transana automatically prompts you to create a transcript.  The dialog box looks like this: <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> To create a transcript, enter <B>Sample Transcript</B> in the Transcript ID field, and your name or initials as the Transcriber.  Click OK.<P>
If you have an existing transcript for your video, you can save that transcript as a Rich Text Format (*.rtf) file in most word processors, then import it into Transana through this screen.<P>
