The Keyword Usage Report can be created three ways.  The distinctions between the versions of the report, while subtle, have important analytic implications.<P>
If you create this report from a Series, the report will list all Episodes within the Series and will show all Keywords assigned to those Episodes.<P>
If this report is created from an Episode, it lists all Clips created from that Episode, regardless of Collection, and shows all the Keywords assigned to those Clips.  It allows you to review all coding applied to a particular source video without respect to the analytic structure imposed by the Collections where Clips are assembled.<P>
If this report is created from a Collection, it lists all Clips in that Collection regardless of what Episode they came from, along with all the Keywords assigned to them.  This allows you to review the coding applied to a set of Clips that have been grouped together in a Collection, presumably for some analytic reason, regardless of the original source of those Clips.<P>
Thus, the Keyword Usage Report for an Episode looks at how various source videos have been divided up analytically, providing information both about analytic categorization implemented by distribution in Collections and about coding that has been applied to the Clips through the assignment of Keywords.  This is a &quot;top-down&quot; look at your data.<P>
In contrast, the Keyword Usage Report for a Collection looks at various portions of video from diverse sources that have been grouped together for analytic reasons, and provides information about the coding that has been applied to them through the assignment of Keywords.  This is a &quot;bottom-up&quot; view of your data.<P>
