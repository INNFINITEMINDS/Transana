If you are using the Student version of Transana, you can skip this page.  Snapshots are only supported in the Professional, Computer Lab, and Multi-User versions of Transana.<P>

There may be times when you would like to insert a coded Snapshot into a Document or Transcript rather than inserting an uncoded still image <A HREF="insertimage.htm">as described previously</A>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Insert a coded Snapshot into a Document or Transcript.<P>

1.  If it's not already loaded, load the <B>Transana with Media</B> Transcript for the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode.  Click in the Visualization Window at about 5:45 in the video so that the Transcript highlights the sentence "Assign a name to your Standard Clip."<P>

2.  Press <IMG SRC="images/EditButton.gif"> &nbsp; to put the Transcript into Edit mode.  Create a blank line in the Transcript above where the Transcript highlight appears.<P>

3.  If the <B>Add Clip Form 1</B> Snapshot is still open, select it through Transana's Window menu.  If it is not open, double-click the <B>Add Clip Form 1</B> Snapshot in the <B>Identifying What Is Important</B> Collection.<P>

4.  It is often helpful to include the Snapshot's Coding Key with the Snapshot in the transcript, as this makes the meaning of the coding shapes clear.  Therefore, press the <IMG SRC="images/KeywordIcon.gif"> &nbsp; "Show Coding Key" button in the Snapshot Window so the Coding Key is displayed.  When the Coding Key is displayed, it will be included when a Snapshot is exported or placed in a Document or Transcript.<P>  

5.  Press the <IMG SRC="images/SnapshotButton.gif"> &nbsp; "Insert Coded Image Into Transcript" button <I>in the Snapshot Window's toolbar</I>.  Now close the Snapshot Window.  You will see your coded Snapshot in the Transcript.  You will also see a hyperlink labelled "(Snapshot link)" which you can click to re-load the Snapshot.  Note that editing the Snapshot after this point will not affect the copy of the image in the Transcript.<P>
