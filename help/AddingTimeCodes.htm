<H2><I>Adding Time Codes</I><HR></H2>

One of Transana's most useful features is its ability to link specific points in a media file with the corresponding points in the Transcript. You create this connection when you insert time codes.<P>

<B>Time Codes</B> are markers (<FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>) placed in a Transcript that help Transana synchronize the Transcript and the media file.  While people in different disciplines have varying needs and may use time codes in a variety of ways, it is usually standard to place time codes at least at the beginning of each turn by each speaker, or at each topic change.  Speaker changes and topic changes represent natural boundaries in data files, and it is often useful and convenient to have time codes to mark such boundaries.<P>

Inserting time codes is similar to transcribing a media file. You play the media file, starting, stopping, and rewinding as necessary, and insert time codes throughout the Transcript. In this tutorial you should insert them at the beginning of each sentence.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT><P>

1. Click the time code icon on the Transcription window tool bar. It's the button with the time code symbol on it. <FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>  You can see that it has two settings, &quot;Show Time Codes&quot; where it appears to be pushed in, and &quot;Hide Time Codes&quot; where it does not.  Make sure it is set to show time codes.  If the Transcript is not in Edit mode, click the Edit Mode icon too.<P>

2.  Make sure the "Transana with Media" video is at the beginning of the file.  The <B>Current</b> time, as shown in the Visualization window's status bar, should read &quot;0:00:00.0.&quot;  If it doesn't, click on the far left edge of the Waveform to position the media file at the beginning.<P>

3. Place the cursor at the beginning of your transcript, right before the narrator says &quot;Please note that this video is not designed to teach you how to analyze media data with Transana.&quot; Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> on Windows or <B>Cmd-T</B> on OS X to insert a time code matching the beginning of the media file with the beginning of the transcript.  (The sentence actually starts at about 2.8 seconds into the file.)<P>

4. Press <B>Ctrl/Cmd-S</B> to start the media file. Watch and wait until the narrator finishes the first sentence.  Immediately after he says &quot;... media data with Transana&quot;, press Ctrl/Cmd-S to pause the media file.  The current time should show approximately &quot;0:00:08.6.&quot;<P>

5. Position the cursor in your transcript at the beginning of the next line, where the narrator says &quot;It is a sample file ....&quot; Press <B>Ctrl/Cmd-T</B> to insert a time code.  (Note that you can also click the button labeled <B>Current:</B> on the Visualization window status bar.)<P>

6. Press <B>Ctrl/Cmd-S</B> (or Ctrl/Cmd-D) to restart the media file. Continue to play and pause the media file, adding time codes at the beginning of each sentence, for as much of the transcript as you have transcribed. <P>

Remember that it's important that the media file be stopped at exactly the point that matches the cursor position in the Transcript where you are inserting the time code. Inserting a time code causes Transana to record the link between the Transcript and the media file at exactly the point where the media file is currently paused. If you pause the media file too soon, or just try to go ahead and insert the time code symbols without playing the media, the links won't line up right with the Transcript.  <P>

(<B>NOTE</B>:  Entering time codes is an integral part of transcribing.  Most people timecode as they are transcribing, not afterwards.  Time coding was only separated from transcription here to make the Tutorial easier to follow and to make learning this new concept a bit easier by isolating it from the issue of controlling video while transcribing.)<P>
