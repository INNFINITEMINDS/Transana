<H2><I>Adding Time Codes<HR ></I></H2><P>
One of Transana's most powerful features is its ability to link specific points in a video with the corresponding points in the transcription. You create this correlation when you insert time codes.<P>
Time Codes are markers (<FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>) placed in a transcript that help Transana synchronize the transcript and the video.  While people in different disciplines have varying needs and may use time codes in a variety of ways, it is usually standard to place time codes at least at the beginning of each turn by each speaker.  <P>
Inserting time codes is similar to transcribing a video. You play the video, starting, stopping, and rewinding as necessary, and insert time codes throughout the transcript. In this tutorial you should insert them at the beginning of each line where there is a different speaker.<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>
1. Click the time code icon on the Transcription window tool bar. It's the button with the time code symbol on it. <FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>  You can see that is has two settings, &quot;Show Time Codes&quot; where it appears to be pushed in, and &quot;Hide Time Codes&quot; where is does not.  Make sure it is set to show time codes.  If the Transcription window is not in Edit mode, click the Edit Mode icon too.<P>
2.  Make sure the video is at the beginning.  The Current Time, as shown in the Visualization window, should read &quot;0:00:00.0.&quot;  If it doesn't, click on the far left edge of the Waveform to position the video at the beginning.<P>
3. Place the cursor at the beginning of your transcript, at the beginning of where the teacher says &quot;<FONT COLOR="Black">This is the core they started with, and they want it to look like that.&quot; Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code at the beginning of that line.</FONT><P>
<FONT COLOR="Black">4. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> to start the video. Watch and wait until the teacher finishes speaking.  Immediately after she says &quot;What happens each time?&quot; Press Ctrl-S to pause the video.  The Current Time should now show approximately &quot;0:00:19.3.&quot;</FONT><P>
<FONT COLOR="Black">5. Position the cursor in your transcript at the beginning of the next line, where a student says &quot;It's the same.&quot; Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code.  (Note that you can also click the button labeled <B>Current:</B> on the Visualization window status bar.)</FONT><P>
<FONT COLOR="Black">6. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> (or Ctrl-D) to restart the video. Continue to start and pause the video, adding time codes at the beginning of each speaker's turn. </FONT><P>
<FONT COLOR="Black">Remember that it's important that the video be stopped at exactly the point that matches the cursor position in the transcript where you are inserting the time code. Inserting a time code causes Transana to record the link between the transcription and the video at exactly the right point. If you stop the video too soon, or just try to go ahead and insert the time code symbols without playing the video, the links won't line up right.  </FONT><P>
