<H2><I>Adding Time Codes</I><HR></H2>

One of Transana's most useful features is its ability to link specific points in a video with the corresponding points in the transcription. You create this connection when you insert time codes.<P>

<B>Time Codes</B> are markers (<FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>) placed in a transcript that help Transana synchronize the transcript and the video.  While people in different disciplines have varying needs and may use time codes in a variety of ways, it is usually standard to place time codes at least at the beginning of each turn by each speaker.  <P>

Inserting time codes is similar to transcribing a video. You play the media file, starting, stopping, and rewinding as necessary, and insert time codes throughout the transcript. In this tutorial you should insert them at the beginning of each line where there is a different speaker.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity: </FONT>Follow these directions:<P>

1. Click the time code icon on the Transcription window tool bar. It's the button with the time code symbol on it. <FONT COLOR="Red">¤</FONT>  You can see that it has two settings, &quot;Show Time Codes&quot; where it appears to be pushed in, and &quot;Hide Time Codes&quot; where it does not.  Make sure it is set to show time codes.  If the Transcription window is not in Edit mode, click the Edit Mode icon too.<P>

2.  Make sure the Demo video is at the beginning.  The <B>Current</b> time, as shown in the Visualization window's status bar, should read &quot;0:00:00.0.&quot;  If it doesn't, click on the far left edge of the Waveform to position the media file at the beginning.<P>

3. Place the cursor at the beginning of your transcript, at the beginning of where the teacher says &quot;This is the core they started with, and they want it to look like that.&quot; Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code at the beginning of that line.<P>

4. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> to start the media file. Watch and wait until the teacher finishes speaking.  Immediately after she says &quot;What happens each time?&quot; Press Ctrl-S to pause the media file.  The current time should now show approximately &quot;0:00:19.3.&quot;<P>

5. Position the cursor in your transcript at the beginning of the next line, where a student says &quot;It's the same.&quot; Press <B>Ctrl-T</B> to insert a time code.  (Note that you can also click the button labeled <B>Current:</B> on the Visualization window status bar.)<P>

6. Press <B>Ctrl-S</B> (or Ctrl-D) to restart the media file. Continue to play and pause the media file, adding time codes at the beginning of each speaker's turn. <P>

Remember that it's important that the media file be stopped at exactly the point that matches the cursor position in the transcript where you are inserting the time code. Inserting a time code causes Transana to record the link between the transcription and the media file at exactly the point where the media file is currently paused. If you pause the media file too soon, or just try to go ahead and insert the time code symbols without playing the media, the links won't line up right with the transcript.  <P>

(<B>NOTE</B>:  Entering time codes is an integral part of transcribing.  Most people timecode as they are transcribing, not afterwards.  Time coding was only separated from transcription here to make the Tutorial easier to follow and to make learning this new concept a bit easier by isolating it from the issue of controlling video while transcribing.)<P>
