<H2><I>Creating More Clips</I><HR></H2>

Follow the same steps outlined in <A HREF="createclips.htm">Creating Standard Clips</A> to add the following clips:<P>

<B>Clips where the children still don't understand:</B><P>

Clip ID:  Carpet, Start Time:  3:53.0, End Time: 4:08.6, Keywords: C. Curtis, Geometry by Design, Symmetry, Confusion<P>

Clip ID:  The Same, Start Time:  4:08.6, End Time: 4:34.8, Keywords: C. Curtis, Geometry by Design, Symmetry, Confusion<P>

<B>Clips where the class moves from the concrete to the abstract and begins to develop the underlying concept of geometric proof:</B><P>

Clip ID:  Proof, Start Time:  5:04.4, End Time: 5:39.7, Keywords: C. Curtis, Geometry by Design, Symmetry, Proof, Confusion<P>

You will notice that Transana adds new clips at the bottom of the collection list.  There are some occasions when you would like to add a clip in a specific position in the clip list.  We want to add the following clip between <B>The Same</B> and <B>Proof</B> because it occurred between those two clips chronologically.<P>

<B>Clips where the children do understand, sort of:</B><P>

Clip ID:  Folding, Start Time:  4:34.8, End Time: 4:53.9, Keywords: C. Curtis, Geometry by Design, Symmetry, Folding, Understanding<P>

To do this, we drop or right-click the clip where we want the new clip to appear instead of selecting the collection.  In this case, we would drag the clip text and drop it on the <B>Proof</B> clip, or we would make our transcript selection and right-click <B>Proof</B>, and then choose <B>Add Clip</B> from the popup menu.<P>

Don't forget to create analytic memos for each of these clips.<P>
