<H2><I>Quick Clips</I><HR></H2>

We now have a collection of standard clips that show what our sample video has to show about these students and their increasing understanding of the concept of symmetry.  We notice that this teacher uses questions in some very interesting ways.  For example, she never defines the term symmetry, but instead asks questions of the students in such a way that they develop a communal definition that appears to be understood and retained by more of the students than other teachers using more traditional approaches.  <P>

Transana provides an alternative method of creating clips called <I>quick clips</I>. Quick clips are very easy to create, and are designed to be created quickly.  They are also explicitly limited to a flat (non-hierarchical) structure. This method of creating clips is appropriate for the sort of open/emergent coding suggested by grounded theory approaches, as well as for analytic approaches that focus on the analysis of Transana's maps and graphs rather than making use of the manipulation of clips in collections for extracting meaning from your media files.<P>

Let's explore this teacher's use of questions using quick clips.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these directions to create a quick clip of one of the teacher questions.<P>

<A HREF="overview.htm">As mentioned earlier</A>, quick clips are keyword-oriented clips, while standard clips are collection-oriented clips.  In the same way that we had to <A HREF="createcollection.htm">create a collection</A> before we could <A HREF="createclips.htm">create a standard clip</A>, we need to <A HREF="creatingkeywords.htm">create a keyword</A> before we can create a quick clip.<P>

1. Right-click the <B>Tutorial</B> keyword group and choose <B>Add Keyword</B>.  Create a keyword called <B>Teacher Question</B> and give it a definition, then press <B>OK</B> to complete the process.<P>

2.  If the <B>Demo</B> episode's <B>Transcript</B> transcript is not currently loaded, load it by double-clicking it in the data window's database tree.<P>

3. At approximately 1:30.8, the teacher asks a question of the class about the software they are using.  You can use the Visualization window to move quickly to that spot, or you can use the text search box in the transcript toolbar to search for the first reference in the transcript to the word "software".  <P>

4. Make sure that time codes are visible in your transcript, then use the mouse to click and drag the cursor to highlight the sentence about why their computer software won't let them do diagonal flips.  The selection runs from about 1:30.8 to about 1:47.0 in the media file.<P>

5. <FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:</FONT>  Right-click the <B>Teacher Question</B> keyword in the data window's database tree. Select the <B>Create Quick Clip<B> option. <P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:</FONT>  Drag the selected text onto the <B>Teacher Question</B> keyword in the data window's database tree.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Another alternative:</FONT>  First check the Options menu, and make sure the <B>Quick Clips Mode</B> item is checked, indicating that quick clips mode is enabled.  Drag a keyword from the data window's database tree onto the transcript.  (If <B>Quick Clips Mode</B> is not checked, this action will add the keyword to the episode or clip currently loaded rather than creating a quick clip.)<P>

Notice that Transana creates a collection called &quot;Quick Clips&quot; if one does not already exist. (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font>  Transana automatically appends your user name onto the quick clips collection to differentiate between the quick clips created by different users.) You will also notice that Transana has created a clip named after the current episode and numbered it to differentiate it from other quick clips created from the same episode. If you load the quick clip (or look at the clip properties) you will also note that the quick clip has been assigned the keyword used to initiate the creation of the quick clip. (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font> Transana will also assign your user name to the quick clip as a keyword, creating a keyword group called "Transana Users" and adding your user name as a keyword to that group if necessary.) <P>

If you want to create a series of quick clips with the same keyword, highlight the desired keyword in the data window's database tree, then for each selection in the transcript, you can press Ctrl-K or the Create Quick Clip button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"> &nbsp;to create the desired quick clips.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create a number of quick clips very rapidly.<P>

1.  In the data window's database tree, select the <B>Teacher Question</B> keyword.<P>

2.  In the Transcript window, scroll to the top of the transcript and click on the top line.<P>

3.  In the Transcript Toolbar, type a question mark into the text search box.<P>

4.  Click the <B>Search Forwards</B> button in the Transcript Toolbar, the right arrow to the right of the text search box.<P>

5.  At each question mark, look at the question.  Insert time codes at the beginning and end of each question, if necessary. (Remember, in the transcript, you can left-click to position the video in a time-coded segment, then right-click to play that segment.)<P>

6.  Then, if the question crosses time codes, highlight the question.  If the questions does not cross time codes, just click in the question (so that there is no selection in the transcript.)  If the question mark indicates unclear transcription or an incidental comment (such as "Okay?") that doesn't really constitute a meaningful question, search for the next question mark.<P>

7.  Press Ctrl-K, or click on the Create Quick Clip button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"> &nbsp; in the transcript toolbar to create the quick clip.  Alternately, you can make a selection in the transcript and double-click the keyword in the database tree to create a quick clip.  (It doesn't matter which method of creating a quick clip you choose.  Try them all, then practice the one that feels most intuitive to you.)<P>

8.  Go back to step 4 above to repeat this process until you have created quick clips for all of the teacher questions in the demo video.<P>

You should now have a collection of about 20 quick clips of teacher questions available for further exploration.  If we wanted to, we could now rename the <B>Quick Clips</B> collection, calling it <B>Teacher Questions</B> or something equally clever.  To do this, you can click on the collection name in the tree to make the collection name editable, or you can right-click the collection, choose <B>Collection Properties</B>, and rename the collection that way.<P>

At this point, you may wish to create a collection note (or multiple clip notes if you prefer) covering the analytic memo data for the quick clips you just created.  <P>

<strong>Note:</strong> Because of how easy it is to create quick clips, some novice Transana users may be tempted to use quick clips in situations where they are not appropriate.  A single clip with multiple keywords allows search-based hypothesis testing that is not possible with multiple identical clips, each with only a single keyword.  Therefore, if you attempt to make multiple quick clips using the same selection and different keywords, Transana will apply the keywords to the same quick clip.<P>
