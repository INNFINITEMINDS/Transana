<H2><I>Quick Clips</I><HR></H2>

We now have a Collection of standard Clips that show several different methods of creating standard Clips from Episodes.  Those who are not using the Standard version of Transana will also some standard Quotes and Quick Quotes in their Collections.  Standard Clip creation requires naming the Clip and choosing a (presumably) analytically meaningful Collection in which to create it.<P>

Transana provides an alternative method of creating Clips called <I>Quick Clips</I>. Quick Clips are fast and easy to create, and are designed to allow coding of media data without requiring as much analytic thought up front.  You can quickly apply coding to media files and figure out later what the coding means.<P>

Let's explore the process of creating Quick Clips.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Follow these directions to create a Quick Clip.<P>

<A HREF="analysisoverview.htm">As mentioned earlier</A>, Quick Clips are Keyword-oriented Clips, while standard Clips are Collection-oriented Clips.  In the same way that we had to <A HREF="createcollection.htm">create a Collection</A> before we could <A HREF="createclips.htm">create a standard Clip</A>, we need to <A HREF="createkeywords.htm">create a Keyword</A> before we can create a Quick Clip.<P>

1. If the <B>Transana with Media</B> Episode's <B>Transana with Media</B> Transcript is not currently loaded, load it by double-clicking it in the Data window's Database Tree.<P>

2. Scroll down to the <B>Quick Clips</B> section of the Transcript, or click in the Visualization window between 9:31.2 and 9:40.4.  Locate the sentence that says " Once you have your selection, you can then double-click a Keyword to create a Quick Clip."  Highlight that sentence between, but not including, the time codes on either side of the words.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/demotranscript3.gif"><P>

3.  Now double-click the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> Keyword.  That's it.  You've created a Quick Clip, matching the text selected in your Transcript, the media start and end times indicated by the surrounding time codes, and with the Keyword you double-clicked.<P>

Let's take a closer look.  In the Collections node of the Database Tree, you will now find a <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection.  If this Collection doesn't already exist, Transana creates it automatically.  (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font>  Transana automatically appends your user name onto the <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection to differentiate between the items created by different users.)<P>

Assuming this is the first Quick Clip you created from this Episdoe, you will find a Clip in the <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection called <B>Transana with Media Quick Clip 1</B>.  Transana takes the name of the Episode and automatically names and numbers the Quick Clip.<P>   

Double-click the new Quick Clip so it opens in the Document window, replacing the Episode Transcript.  You will see just the selected Transcript text.  Looking in the Visualization Window or at the Keywords Tab in the Data Window, you will see that the Quick Quote has the <B>Tutorial : Episode</B> Keyword, which it inherited from the Episode coding and the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> Keyword, which you used to trigger the Quick Clip creation.  (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font> Transana will also assign your user name to the Quick Clip as a Keyword, creating a Keyword Group called "Transana Users" and adding your user name to that group if necessary.)<P>

4.  In the Data Window, right-click the <B>Transana with Media Quick Clip 1</B> Clip and select <B>Locate Clip in Episode</B> from the menu.  This will re-load the source Episode and will highlight the text between the time codes used to create the Clip.  Without moving the selection in the Transcript, double-click the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword.  Transana will add additional Keywords to your existing Quick Clip, rather than creating a new, duplicate Quick Clip, when you signal the creation of another Quick Clip without changing your text selection.  A single Clip with multiple Keywords is analytically more useful than multiple identical-text Clips with one Keyword each.<P>  

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create another Quick Clip.<P>

1.  Scroll down until you see the sentence 'Another way to trigger the creation of a Quick Clip is to right-click a Keyword and choose "Create Quick Clip".'  Click somewhere in that sentence, without making a selection.<P>

2.  Right-click the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> Keyword and choose "Create Quick Clip" from the menu.  You should notice that a new Clip appears in the Data Window's <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection.  If you are displaying the Keyword Visualization rather than the Waveform Visualization, the coding for the Clip will be reflected in the Visualization Window.<P>    

3.  Without changing your text selection, right-click the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword and choose <B>Create Quick Clip</B> to add this Keyword to the existing Quick Clip.  You will notice that no new Clip is created, but the coding is added to the Visualization window after a moment.<P> 

4.  If you double-click the newest Clip to load it in Transana's interface.  You will notice Transana selected all of the text between the time codes surrounding your cursor since you did not make a selection in the Transcript.<P> 

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create another Quick Clip.<P>

1.  Highlight the first sentence of the next paragraph, which says " Or, you can make a highlight selection and drag that text, and drop it onto a Keyword."<P>

2.  Drag the selected text from the Transcript to the Data window and drop the text on the <B>Tutorial : Clip</B> Keyword to create a new Quick Clip.  Grab the text again and drag it to the <B>Tutorial : Quick Creation Method</B> Keyword to add the additional Keyword to the Clip.<P>   

If you want to create a series of Quick Clips with the same Keyword, highlight the desired Keyword in the Database Tree.  Then, for each selection you make in the Transcript, you can press Ctrl-K or the <B>Create Quick Quote or Clip</B> button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"> &nbsp;in the Document Toolbar to create the desired Quick Clip using the time codes on either side of your selection as the Clip boundaries.<P>

At this point, you may wish to create a Collection Note (or multiple Clip Notes if you prefer) covering the analytic memo information for the Quick Clips you just created.  <P>

One final note.  You have just created a group of related Quick Clips (and Quotes if you are not using the Standard version of Transana.)  We could leave things as they are, in which case, these Quick Quotes and Clips will get mixed in with later Quick Quotes and Clips we create for other reasons.  Alternately, we could rename our <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection to reflect the common theme for this group of Quotes and Clips.<P>

<FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Rename your <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection.<P>

1.  Right-click your <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection and choose <B>Collection Properties</B> from the menu.<P>

2.  Change the Collection ID to "Creating Quick Quotes and Clips" and press the <B>OK</B> button.<P>

3.  The next time you create a new Quick Quote or Quick Clip, a new <B>Quick Quotes and Clips</B> Collection will be created for the new group of Quotes and Clips.<P>
