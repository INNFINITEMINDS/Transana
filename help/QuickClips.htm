<P>
Transana provides an alternative method of creating clips called <I>quick clips</I>. Quick clips are very easy to create, but are also explicitly limited to a flat (non-hierarchical) structure. This method of creating clips is recommended for the sort of open/emergent coding suggested by grounded theory approaches, as well as for analytic approaches that focus on the analysis of Transana's maps and graphs rather than making use of the manipulation of clips in collections for extracting meaning from your media files.

<P>Generally speaking, the use of quick clips is intended to support the following approaches to clip creation. First, in the early stages of an analysis, a researcher is engaged in open coding as a path to allowing analytically relevant evidence to emerge from the analysis of his or her data. This open coding approach allows for the quick creation of non-ordered selections that can later be merged or ordered in a hierarchy as a part of finer categorization (axial coding).

<P>Second, some projects approach video analysis with a closed coding vocabulary of mutually exclusive terms - no subcategories are used. This situation is also a good one for quick clips.

<P>Finally, quick clips are also a useful tool for checking inter-rater reliability or exploring different approaches to coding the same data. In this case, one could take advantage of Transana-MU's ability to manage each user's quick clips. This facility allows research team members (or a research supervisor) to easily compare the analysis of each team member.

<P>Quick clips are, by definition, easy to create and use. Many researchers will use them in combination with collection and keyword hierarchies. Most analytical approaches support the introduction of finer subcategorization, a feature of clip collections.

<P><FONT COLOR="Red">Activity:</FONT> Create a Quick Clip.

<p>1. Select a portion of a transcript covering the text you want to include in your quick clip, just as you would with any other clip.</p>

<p>2. <FONT COLOR="Red">Right-click option:</FONT>  Right-click a keyword in the data window's database tree. Select the &quot;Create Quick Clip&quot; option. </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="Red">Drag-and-drop option:</FONT>  Drag the selected text onto a keyword in the data window's database tree.</p>

<p><FONT COLOR="Red">Another alternative:</FONT>  First check the Options menu, and make sure the &quot;Quick Clips Mode&quot; item is checked, indicating that quick clips mode is enabled.  Drag a keyword from the data window's database tree onto the transcript.  (If &quot;Quick Clips Mode&quot;is not checked, this action will add the keyword to the episode or clip currently loaded rather than creating a quick clip.)</p>

<p>Notice that Transana creates a collection called &quot;Quick Clips&quot; if one does not already exist. (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font>  Transana automatically appends your user name onto the quick clips collection to differentiate between the quick clips created by different users.) You will also notice that Transana has created a clip named after the current episode and numbered it to differentiate it from other quick clips created from the same episode. If you load the quick clip (or look at the clip properties) you will also note that the quick clip has been assigned the keyword used to initiate the creation of the quick clip. (<Font Color="RED">Multi-user Version note:</Font> Transana will also assign your user name to the quick clip as a keyword, creating a keyword group called "Transana Users" and adding your user name as a keyword to that group if necessary.) </p>

<P>If you want to create a series of quick clips with the same keyword, highlight the desired keyword in the data window's database tree, then for each selection in the transcript, you can press Ctrl-K or the Create Quick Clip button <IMG SRC="images/quickclipicon.gif"> &nbsp;to create the desired quick clips.</P>

<P><strong>Note:</strong> Because of how easy it is to create quick clips, some novice Transana users may be tempted to use quick clips in situations where they are not appropriate.  A single clip with multiple keywords allows search-based hypothesis testing that is not possible with multiple identical clips, each with only a single keyword.  Therefore, if you attempt to make multiple quick clips using the same selection and different keywords, Transana will simply apply the keywords to the same quick clip.
