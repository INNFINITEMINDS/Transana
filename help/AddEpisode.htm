To add an <A HREF="organization.htm">Episode</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) a named <A HREF="organization.htm">Series</A> in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Episode.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is an &quot;Episode ID&quot; which must be unique within that Series and a &quot;Media Filename&quot; that identifies the video or audio file you wish to work with.  &quot;Date Taped&quot; should identify the date the media file was recorded, if known, and is especially helpful when working with large collections of video.  &quot;Title/Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  The &quot;Series ID&quot; and the &quot;Length&quot; field are filled in automatically by Transana and cannot be edited.   By selecting a Keyword Group and Keyword, then clicking the <IMG SRC="images/addkw.gif"  ALT="addkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;button, you can add as many analytic keywords as you wish to each Episode.  Selecting a Keyword Group : Keyword combination in the Keywords list and pressing <IMG SRC="images/delkw.gif"  ALT="delkw"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;removes a keyword from the list, and pressing <IMG SRC="images/keywordmanagementbutton.gif"  ALT="keywordmanagementbutton"   BORDER=0> &nbsp;allows you to access <A HREF="kwmgt.htm">Keyword Management</A>.<P>

Please note that all Media Filenames must be unique at the file name level.  That is, once you have created an episode from a media file with a given name, do not use the same media file name to represent a different piece of video or audio media for analysis in Transana, even if that media file is stored in a different folder on your computer.<P>
