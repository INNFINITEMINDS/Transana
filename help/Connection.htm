<H1>The Connection Button<HR ></H1>
<P>
The Connection Button facilitates connection to the <A HREF="srb.htm">Storage Resource Broker</A>.  You must have a SRB account to connect to the SRB.
<P>
Local files are located on the hard drive(s) of your computer, or on your local area network.  NOTE:  For files from the LAN to be available to the File Management Utility, you must Map the Network Drive prior to starting the File Management Utility.  See your Operating System manual for instructions on how to do this.
<P>
Remote files are stored on a Storage Resource Broker, or <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A>.  A <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> is a system designed for storage of large amounts of data, such as video files.
<P>
The reason this capacity was added to <A HREF="transana.htm">Transana</A> is because video files tend to be quite large, (over 600 Megabytes for an hour of MPEG-1 video,) and large collections of video files can easily overwhelm a system's hard drive.  Using the File Management Utility, you can store the bulk of your video collection on a <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A>, designed to hold large amounts of data, and copy just the few files you want to work on to your local hard drive as you need them.  The <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> also facilitates the secure transmission of video files between locations for collaborative projects.
<P>
To connect to the <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A>, press the &quot;Connect&quot; button.  If you do not yet have a connection to the <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> established, the <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> Connection window will open:

You should have been provided with all the necessary information to complete this form when you were given your <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> account.
<P>
Known <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> Hosts ready to store video data for <A HREF="transana.htm">Transana</A> include <B>storage.wcer.wisc.edu</B> and <B>srb.sdsc.edu</B>.
<P>
The <A HREF="srb.htm">SRB</A> Host Port varies depending on the setup of the SRB Host you are connecting to.  storage.wcer.wisc.edu currently uses <B>5544</B>.
<P>
The only known Domain for use with <A HREF="transana.htm">Transana</A> at this time is <B>digital-insight</B>.<P>
There may be a variety of resources available.  <B>WCERSRBV1</B> and <B>WCERSRBV2</B> are disk-based resources at the University of Wisconsin's Wisconsin Center for Education Research.  <B>unix-sdsc</B> is disk-based storage at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, and <B>hpss-sdsc</B> is tape-based long-term storage.  Please be sure you have permission before storing data on any particular resource.
<P>
For SEA Options, <B>ENCRYPT1</B> usually works.  If this does not work, you may be able to leave this field blank.
<P>
The Buffer Size parameter sets the size of the transfer buffer.  Larger buffer sizes tend to facilitate faster file transfers, depending on connection speed.  However, the progress dialog is less responsive to user input and updates less frequently as the buffer size increases.
<P>
If you choose to connect to your own storage space, you will be connected to the \domain\home\username.domain Collection on the host you define.  If someone else has given you permission to access files in their storage space, you can enter the username and domain they use to connect to their storage space to access their files.
