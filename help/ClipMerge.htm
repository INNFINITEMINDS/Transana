<P>
Transana can consolidate two adjacent clips into a single clip.  To initiate this process, right-click a clip and choose "Merge Clips" from the popup menu.  Transana displays the clip's information, along with a list of clips that either immediately preceed or immediately follow that clip.<P>

<P>
Please note that clips must share a boundary time code to be considered adjacent, ending at the current clip's start or starting at the current clip's end.  Clips also must be drawn from the same set of episode transcripts.
<P>
Select a clip from the "Clips to Merge" field, and the form changes to reflect the merged data.  The clip start or stop time changes, the clip transcript(s) are combined, and the clip keywords are merged.  The clip id is not automatically changed, but you can change it if you want to.  If one of the merged clips was serving as a keyword example, the merged clip is substituted appropriately.
