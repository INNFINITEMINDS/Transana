<H1>Import Spreadsheet Data</H1><HR>

Please note that the <B>Basic</B> version of Transana does not support importing Spreadsheet data.  To use this feature, you must be using the <B>Professional</B>, <B>Computer Lab</B>, or <B>Multiuser</B> version of Transana.<P> 

<H2>Introduction</H2>

If you have spreadsheet or survey data, you may want to import Comma Separated Values or Tab Delimited Text Files into Transana for analysis.  <B>Import Spreadsheet Data</B> allows you to create a library of <A HREF="documentproperties.htm">Documents</A> based on the contents of a single data file in Comma Separated Values (*.csv) or Tab Delimited Text (*.txt) format. Transana provides a structured tool for this.<P>

This type of data is organized in a grid.  You will find that your headings, prompts, or questions fall along one axis and your individual participants are listed along the other axis.  Such files can contain a variety of data types, including numeric, categorical, and text data.<P>

<H2>Preparing your data</H2>

Transana works with Comma Separated Values (*.csv), and Tab Delimited Text (*.txt) formats.  If your data is in Excel format or a format specific to another spreadsheet programs, you will need to load your data in your Spreadsheet program and convert it to Comma Separated Values format (*.csv) or Tab Delimited Text format (*.txt) for import into Transana.  More information on exporting data from Excel and about file encoding is available at the bottom of this page.<P>

In addition, you may wish to prepare your data before import.  Transana offers the option of automatically coding your imported data based on information in the data file, but there are limits to the length of such codes.  You need to be sure that the question and longest response for any field you want to auto-code is unique within the first 80 characters.  This can be a little tricky, especially for items that allow multiple selections in answer to a single question.<P>

<H2>Bringing spreadsheet data into Transana</H2>

To begin importing a Spreadsheet Data file, right-click the Library where Documents should be created and choose "Import Spreadsheet Data".  It is probably a good idea to create a new Library for each Spreadsheet Data Import you perform.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SpreadsheetSelectFile.gif"><P>

On the first page of the Spreadsheet Data import process, you select the file you wish to import and identify the file encoding that was used to create that file.  Once you have selected a file and its associated encoding, press the "Next >" button.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SpreadsheetOrientation.gif"><P>

The next page shows the data in the first row of your data file and the data in the first column of your data file.  One of these two data lists should show the headings, prompts, or questions in your data file, while the other should show the participant data associated with the first heading, prompt, or question.  Use the checkboxes at the bottom of the form to let Transana know whether your headings, prompts, or questions appear in rows or columns in the data file.<P>   

<IMG SRC="images/SpreadsheetOrganize.gif"><P>

The third page in the import process allows you to specify what data to import from the file.  There are two items to complete on this page:<P>

At the top, you can select a data item from the file which uniquely identifies the participants.  Data from this item will be used to indicate which participant is associated with that participant's responses.  Researchers often use pseudonyms or ID numbers rather than using participants real names.  If there is no unique identifier field that you want to include in your imported data, you can request that Transana create a unique identifier for each of your partiicpants.<P>

The rest of the page displays a list of all of the headings, prompts, or questions in your data file.  Initially, all items are selected.  You should select the data items you want to include in the Documents created during data import and (optionally) for which to auto-create Quotes.  Click in the list to select a single item.  Use shift-Click to select a range of items after an initial selection.  Use Ctrl-click on Windows or Cmd-click on OS X to select or de-select individual items from this list.<P>

<IMG SRC="images/SpreadsheetAutocode.gif"><P>

Finally, you will see a page that allows you to select whether to auto-create Quotes during data import, and to select what data items you want to use for automatic coding of your Documents and Quotes.   Note that Keywords will be created in the "Auto-code" Keyword Group and will be applied at the Document and Quote levels.  <P>

When you press the "Finish" button, Transana will import your data file, creating the Documents, Quotes, and Keywords that you have specified.  Depending on the size and complexity of this data, this process may take several minutes.  The Progress Bar should give you an indication of how long the process will take.<P>

<H2>Exporting Data from Excel</H2>

<I>Please note that this description is based on Excel 2010 for Windows.  It is meant as a description of what works for me at this time, and you may need to adapt certain details and specific settings to get it working correctly for you.</I><P>

If you are working in English or a language based on the Latin alphabet, including many western-European languages, you can use Excel to export  a <B>Comma Separated Values (*.csv)</B> file.  Load your spreadsheet in Excel.  Choose File > Save As.  On the Save As form, change the "Save as Type" to "CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)" and enter a file name.  Press Save.  This will save a plain text file with comma separated values using the encoding that Microsoft selects based on your operating system language.  Transana defaults to "CP1252" encoding for CSV files, which is a good guess for English and many common European languages.<P>

If you cannot figure out the file encoding for your language or Excel's CSV format does not appear to support the characters in your language, you may want to save your data as a <B>Tab Delimited Text</B> file using UTF-16 encoding instead.  Load your spreadsheet in Excel.  Choose File > Save As.  On the Save As form, change the "Save as Type" to "Unicode Text (*.txt)" and enter a file name.  (Please note that this is different than the "Text (Tab delimited) (*.txt)" format option.)  Press Save.  This will save a Unicode text file with tab delimited values using "UTF-16" encoding.  You can then use that encoding value for importing the file into Transana.<P>

<H2>File Encodings</H2>

The English alphabet, made up of 26 upper case characters and 26 lower case characters and not including accents, is known as the ASCII character set.  These 52 characters, along with numbers, punctuation symbols common to English, and a selection of special characters, are well known to computers and are handled the same way almost everywhere.<P>  

If your data includes characters that are not used in English, there are a variety of different systems for storing characters not included in the ASCII character set, such as accented characters and non-Latin characters.  Such systems for storing characters are known as <B>encodings</B>, and the general rule is that you need to know what file encoding was used to save a file in order to read that file correctly.  Unfortunately, there is no commonly-accepted standard for specifying what encoding was used within a plain text file.  Some programs allow you to select an encoding when you save a file, but with others, you are just supposed to know what encoding was used.<P>

If you are using Excel, please see the section on exporting data from Excel above.  If you are using a different program, you will need to export your data into a Comma Separated Values file or a Tab Delimited Text file.  You may be able to select an encoding when exporting a file.  (If so, UTF-8 is usually a good choice.)  If you are not able to specify what encoding to use, you may need to do a little research on the Internet to find out what encoding system your program uses by default.  Either way, you will need to know the file encoding used by the program that saves the file in order for Transana to read and correctly interpret that file.<P>
