To add a <A HREF="organization.htm">Transcript</A> in Transana, right-click (Ctrl-click on the Mac) an &quot;Episode&quot; node in the <A HREF="datawindow.htm">Data window</A> and choose &quot;Add Transcript.&quot;  You will see the dialog box shown above.  The only required information is a &quot;Transcript ID&quot; that is unique within the Episode.  &quot;Transcriber&quot; can be used to indicate the name of the person who created the Transcript, and &quot;Comment&quot; can be used in any way you wish.  You can import Rich-Text Format (*.rtf) documents, Transcripts exported from Transana in XML format (*xml), or plain text (*.txt) documents encoded with Latin-1 encoding using the &quot;RTF/XML/TXT File to Import&quot; field and the associated &quot;Browse&quot; button.<P>

Some Transana users, particularly "form-based" conversation analysts, prefer a highly structured form of transcription where each line is handled independently and paragraph formatting is not used.  The following recommendations make this style of transcription easier in Transana:<P>

First, a fixed-width font should be used.  &quot;Courier New&quot; is the most commonly used font.  <P>
Second, each line should end with the "Enter" or "Return" key being pressed.  That is, each line should be its own paragraph.<P>
Third, line length should be managed manually.  If you are using a 12 point Courier New font, lines should be limited to 64 characters on Windows and 59 characters on OS X.  If you are using a 10 point Courier New font, lines should be limited to 79 characters on Windows and 71 characters on OS X.  This allows the transcript to be printed neatly on US Letter size paper.  Your analytic needs, of course, may differ. <P>
Finally, the &quot;Min Width&quot; field on the Transcript Properties should be set to prevent the transcript window from becoming so small that word wrap will cause formatting problems for the transcript.  A transcript width of about 720 pixels seems about right on Windows, while on OS X, a minimum width of about 520 pixels seems about right.  Of course, your analytic needs and hardware may require different values for your particular situation.<P>
